INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

On 23 February 2023 | commenced an investigation into the death of Denise Jane PORTER.
The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest. The conclusion of the inquest was:
Suicide. The medical cause of death was: 1a Decapitation.

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

On 19th February 2023, the deceased jumped on to the tracks of Platform 2 at Turnham
Green Underground Station into the path of an oncoming train. She sustained multiple injuries
incompatible with life. At the time she was under the care of Oxleas NHS Trust Adults’
Community Mental Health Team. She believed she had early onset dementia which was
being investigated. She had poor sleep and low mood in the months prior to her death but
there was no formal diagnosis for her mental condition at the time of her death.
CORONER'S CONCERNS

British Transport Police made a referral to the Older Adult Community Mental Health Team,
Oxleas NHS Trust, on 25th January 2023, following an incident at Hither Green Station, when
Mrs Porter had altempted to end her life by standing in front of an incoming train, ‘which
stopped.

The 9 page referral included information that Mrs Porter: *..made a deliberate act to jump
conto the tracks in front of a train” and ""Q: In your opinion, due to proximity of lethal means if it
hadn't been for certain actions would death or serious harm have occurred? A:Yes"". The
summary of the incident on page 4, was only partially complete, in that it did not include the
information that the train had stopped. It stated she: ""decided to jump down on to the tracks to
take her own life but then changed her mind and came back onto the platform’.

The inquest heard the Trust did not interrogate the Safeguarding and Vulnerability Report,
prepared by British Transport Police. The Trust Staff relied on the summary of the incident,
both at the triage stage and subsequently during the psychiatric reviews. The Trust staff did
not contact British Transport Police again to establish any information about the incident (for
example the CCTV was not viewed nor a summary of the footage requested, nor were any
‘meetings convened or discussions held between the Trust and British Transport Police.

The Trust conducted a review of the care and treatment provided to Mrs Porter. Their Report
stated: ""Had the referral from BTP to ACMHT included a full account of the circumstances of
the incident on 25 January 2023, the OACMHT would have had a fuller understanding of the
level of intent exhibited on that occasion, and subsequently risks would have been

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(On 26 July 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of MORGAN-
ROSE HART aged 18. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on
1 December 2023. The conclusion of the jury Inquest was 1a Hypoxic Ischaemic
Brain Injury 1b Cardiac Arrest 1c Ligature Misadventure Contributed by Neglect

Morgan-Rose Har's transfer to adult services was not supported enough with a
clear transfer to ease her anxieties and worries. From the transfer to Chelmer
ward Morgan-Rose's medical history, diagnosis and triggers including her
‘communication passport were not fitered down to staff who were tasked to
providing her day-to-day care. Morgan-Rose's known triggers and change in
behaviour were not observed or dacumented whist she was presenting
behaviours of her mental health deteriorating. For example, doing her make up,
spending more time alone and losing weight. Observations mainly being
‘Completed via the Oxevision system apart from the level 3 observations. There
was limited therapeutic engagements or attempts to engage with Morgan-Rose.
Staff observations being falsified led to Morgan-Rose not being checked and
she felt staff did not have time for her. On the day of the 6th July 2022, ertical
observations were missed, Oxevision alerts were muted or reset without the
correct procedures being adhered to, contributed to Morgan-Rase being lt
unattended in her bathroom for approximately 50 minutes after the Oxevision
red alert was reset on display 01, inthis time she tied a ligature around her
neck. Morgan-Rose expressed she did not want to die but was high risk of selt-
hharm and had a history of ligaturing, It was also documented Morgan-Rose was

‘known to mask her behaviours, When reduced to Level 2 and Lavel 7
‘observations the correct risk assessments including room checks were not
‘completed. Resulting in restricted items being easily accessed. This increased
the risk of self-harm. The failure of basic protocol and procedure documented by
Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust resulted in Morgan-Rose
Hart dying by Misadventure Contributed by Neglect.

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Morgan Rose died on 12% July 2022 atthe Princess Alexander Hospital,
Hamistel Road, Harlow, Essex following being found unresponsive on the
bathroom flor of her room. Morgan-Rose Hart was detained under section 3 of
the Mental Health Act atthe Derwent Centre on the female ward called
Chelmer. Morgan-Rose had ted a ligature around her neck which resulted in a
Cardiac Arrest and then Hypoxic Ischaemic Brain Injury. Morgan-Rose Hart was
pronounced dead on the 12"" July 2022 after brain stem testing confirmed
Morgan-rose Hart had sustained reversible Brian Injury.

(On 6"" July 2022 events contributed to Morgan-Rose's mental health
deterioration, Morgan-Rose was not observed clinically since 14:08 and the time
in between the last observation and when Morgan-Rose was discovered
‘multiple failings occurred. These include non-clinical and clinical staff
commenting on her appearance, a delivery of flowers triggering a response,
observation Level 1 missed the folowing hour, as well asthe consecutive hours
observations also being incorrect and falsified. Other events during the day
triggered an emotional response clinical staff reflecting unescorted leave and no
therapeutic engagement was made to see if Morgan-Rose was okay.

After the delivery ofthe flowers incorrectly delivered to Morgan-Rose. Morgan-
Rose attempted to contact relatives to clarify who these were from as there was
‘Some confusion as to who the flowers were Tor. The flowers were nt meant for
Morgan-Rose.

Whilst Morgan-Rose was in the bedroom mutiple attempts were made to
interact with the Oxevision system to check vital signs, although the system
could not access this due tothe tile being Amber stating that Morgan-Rose was
in the bathroom,

Regardless of the Oxevision no member of staff attempted a physical welfare
‘check until she was discovered unresponsive on the bathroom floor, inthe
shower, fully clothes at 16:20:37, confirmed on CCTV records. Staff proceeded
to perform CPR and resuscitation until paramedics arrived at 16:27. Morgan-
rose was left unattended for approximately 50 minutes prior to being found with
the igature around her neck. Morgan’s last physical check was at 14:08,
Morgan-Rose had not had recorded observations for 2 hours and 14 minutes
according to CCTV footage.

CORONER'S

CONCERNS,
During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to
concem. In my opinion there isa risk that future deaths will occur unless action
is taken. In the circumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as fllows. —

Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust.

(1) The Trust investigation was materially incomplete and there was a lost
‘an opportunity to:
‘. Understand concerns of the Family
b. Acknowledge errors and leam lessons from the circumstances of the
death. The Director of Operations and Matron informed the Trust
‘Senior Management that the PSII Report had omissions. The Trust
evidence was that it was an early adopter of the new NHS
Investigation process. The lead investigator did not report on material
Issues as to how Morgan-Rose was observed on the ward and the
report was significantly delayed. Evidence was there was a pressure
to sign the report off although it remained incomplete and did not
Contain a note about the imitations.

Escalate concerns about staff observations - About 2 weeks after the
death the Matron received a report that staff observations had not
been appropriately conducted. This prompted a review of CCTV from
the afternoon of Morgan-Rose’s death. There was insufficient
serutiny of the CCTV that showed that multiple observations entries
‘made on 6 July 2022 after 14:06 hours could not be correct.

fe. Understand security issues on a locked mental health ward - It has
‘ot been possible to establish the identity of the person that reset the
bathroom alert triggered for Morgan-Rose on 6 July 2022 at 15:31,
The Trust does not have an accurate records of Trust staf pass
allocation. The Trust investigation did not establish that staff
borrowed each other’s security passes. On the day of Morgan-Rose's
death a visitor pass issued that had access to the nursing office. The
Trust was unable to provide the identity of this person.

(2) There was a dispute in evidence over whether it was or was not
permitted for patients to have belts on Chelmer Ward, that has not been
resolved,
fa. Morgan-Rose was on 1:1 observation due to her high risk of selt-

harm that including ligaturing and a belt was in her possession
The Responsible Clinician and a Ward Manager providing support to

‘laff gave evidence at that time that balls ware not permitted

©. The Trust senior management stated that belts were permitted and
referenced the policy. The Updated ward documentation ‘Handover
Checklist’ approved in October 2023 contains belts on a list of
prohibited items. The Trust has stated that this is not correct although
this was par ofthe After-Action Review and is in current use.

(@) Escalation of risk ~ Morgan-Rose attempted to secure unescorted leave
(on the morning of her death, her Responsible Clinician had only
authorised escorted leave. This was not escalated to the nurse in charge
and the Responsible Clinician was not informed.

(4) Bathroom alerts - Evidence was heard that an Oxevision alert is
triggered if a person isin the bathroom for more than 3 minutes and staff
are requited to complete an in-person check. Morgan-Rose was left in
the bathroom unobserved for approximately 50 minutes. It was not clear
from the evidence how the Trust proposes to ensure compliance in
respect ofthis duty.

(6) Trust oversight of care ~ the quality of record keeping was acknowledged
‘ot to be appropriate by nurses and senior staff during evidence, yet had
been signed of:

‘. Observations sheets for vulnerable detained mental patients were
signed off by nurses in charge as being appropriate despite an
absence of any recorded therapeutic engagement

b. Omissions in the recording of food and fluid charts required by the

",1710,"1. Insufficient support and clear transfer for Morgan-Rose Hart during her transition to adult services, leading to a lack of awareness and understanding of her medical history, triggers, and behavioral changes.
2. Falsified staff observations and limited therapeutic engagement, resulting in neglect and a failure to check on Morgan-Rose, leading to her unattended time in the bathroom and subsequent ligature tying.
3. Incomplete and delayed investigation by the Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, including a failure to address concerns from the family and learn from the circumstances of Morgan-Rose's death.
4. Lack of understanding and resolution regarding the permission of patients to have belts on the ward, contributing to the presence of a belt in Morgan-Rose's possession.
5. Failure to escalate the risk of Morgan-Rose attempting unescorted leave and a lack of compliance with bathroom alert protocols.
6. Inadequate oversight of care, including inappropriate record-keeping, omissions in food and fluid charts, and staff potentially relying on Oxevision instead of face-to-face observations.
7. Significant shortage of appropriate placements for individuals with autism and mental health and self-harm risks in Essex, both inpatient and in the community.","Morgan-Rose Hart, an 18-year-old who was detained under the Mental Health Act, died as a result of a hypoxic ischemic brain injury and cardiac arrest caused by ligature misadventure.

During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving ise to concer. In
mn opinion there isa sk that future deaths could accur unless action i taken. In the
‘roumstances iis my statutory duly to report to you

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are 2s folows. —
[BRIEF SUMMARY OF MATTERS OF CONCERN}

(4) During the inquest, it became clear that one significant entry inthe clinical notes
‘made by someone ina separate service commissioned by the Essex

PParnership Universiy Trust and which expressed a very specie and imminent
intention from the deceased to end her ife, was nol seen By aters inthe clinical
team. This was almost certainly because the clinical record does not present on
Computer sereens as a continous chronological running record, buts instead
‘ewe thematicaly. That means that readers are likely to look at entries made
within thie particular clinical team, rather than see what others have recorded
‘more recently. Thera is an obvious rik that ertical and important information
{gamered by others and put into the medical records will not be Seen, and that
those making clinical decisions on risk management wil hus be unaware of
potentially very significant information

(2) The evidence was such that neither the care co- Ordnator nor the consultant
payehiatrist asthe medical lead ofthe service specifically considered the
Siruclured risk management too thal the Trust operates, preferring to rly on
Clnial experience and judgment alone. There may be ask that not using such
Fisk management tools in combination with cinial experience and judgment,
particularly if this is being done by one cnzian at an appoiniment rather than
mulidiscipinary discussion of changes in presentation, may lead to information
boing missed.

(@) There was also evidence about the measures that the British Transport Police
hae taken, seeking to provide adltonal support by eeting up mul agency
suppor plan, which provided a system for alerting a number of people Inciuding
the decoased’s care co-ordinator, when sha atended at raiway stations, In
tact, or various reasons, although ther are several known attendances at
railway slations, none were passed onto the care co- Ordinator. The evidence
at the inquest was that Briish Transport Police does not have the resources
Always to provide information about attendances at unstated stations (afiough
infact, one such attendance had been known about but was not passed on).
‘The pian a presented does not make entirely claar what the imitations in
relation to information from alardances at unstaffed stations may be, and
‘haul remain the poston that BTP lacks the resources to identi all such
attendances at ralway staons by persons at specie riskof suicide onthe
rail, there ls ack that hase expacting fo receive information under such a
lan may not realise thatthe plan wil often not assist where its subject is

‘This was the fist Ofsted inspection that Caversham Primary School (CPS') had had for 13
years. There was previously a polley which meant that schaols which Rad been rated
‘utstanding were not inspected in Ine with usual timescales. There wae a policy change in
2021, and CPS was therefore due an inspection. This was the reason for the inspection in
November 2022.

(CPS underwent an Ofsta inspection on the 15% and 16"" of Navember 2022, after receiving &
phone call to notiy them ofthis at 1pm on 14° November 2022. Ruth's mental health
Setenorated significantly during and after the inspection. She displayed suicidal ideation and

‘The longest ofthese was 30 working days
Parts ofthe Ofsted inspection were conducted in a manner which lacked faimess,
respect and sensitivity (these are the terms used in Ofsted's Code of Conduct). This
likely had an effect on Ruth's ably to deal fly withthe inspection process. Its
very important to stress here that, although I necessarily had to consider the conduct
ofthe inspectors inthis matter, the focus should not be on any Individual inspector,
but more on the system, plies and training.
‘There is very Ite training by Ofsted, and ne written policy, regarding management
(of school leader anxiety during Inspections
‘The suggestion that an inspection euld be paused for reason of school leader
distress was not part of Ofsted's policy or training
Ofsted's confidentiality requirements (between Inspection and final publication ofthe

years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Michael Hindes kiled hinsel ——_——— [i a.
‘One week before he died, he called 999 because he felt suicidal. This
was late in the evening on Monday, 8 May. Police attended and took
him to St George's Hospital, where he underwent a half hour mental
health assessment, after which he was discharged in the early hours.

CORONER'S CONCERNS.

During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving
rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur
unless action is taken. In the circumstances, itis my statutory duty to
report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows,

When Michael was taken to St George's Hospital, he explained that he
had been back and forth from the railway station, each 7
— Es

He was discharged with a plan for follow up by the community mental
health team (CMHT). | was told that the local CMHT meets at the
beginning of every week, and then there is sometimes a delay before an
appointment is made, so it was likely that Michael would have to wait an
absolute minimum of a week to be seen.

In the meantime, it was not thought necessary to refer him to the crisis,
team.

Michae''s family knew nothing of his mental ill health. He declined an
invitation by the nurse assessing him to contact them, He did not want
to worry them. Despite her awareness of the multiple therapeutic
benefits of the input of a patient's loved ones, the assessing nurse did
rot in any way try to persuade Michael to allow her to do this.

‘The first that Michae''s family heard of Michael's mental il health was
when they heard of his death. | am sure that, had they been made aware
of it while he was still alive, they would have done everything in their
power to support him and to engage with the mental health services.

Families very often complain to me at inquest that mental health services
have not done enough to try to bring them in to a patient's care. In spite
Of the frequency of this occurrence, the lesson does not seem to be being
learnt.

When you respond to ths letter, | should be grateful to know not just what
you have done to address the issue in your own trust, but also what you
have done to raise national awareness.

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and |
believe that you have the power to take such action.

You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date
of this report, namely by 18 December 2023. |, the coroner, may extend

Despite a report from the Health and Social Care committee from 2021 this case showed
that there does nat seem to have been any Feal Improvement and more lives are likely to
be lst

Reading from this report, It says “The conclusion ofthis report was that Autistic people (and
people with learning csabllties) have the right to live Independent, fee, and fullled lives
Inthe community and itis an unacceptable violation of tir human rights to deny them
the chance fo do 20.""

‘The report identified that ""the community support and provision for autistic people (and
those with learning affculies) and financial investment in those services ‘= sgnficantiy
below te level required to meet the needs of those individuals and to provide adequate
Support for them inthe community.”

‘The Inquest heard that two years on there stil remains an acute shortage of provision.
Evidence was heard that East Sussex Counel had tried ever 30 providers to help pun
place support for Jessie nut they could not find a placement for her so the ony provision
that they were able to offer ner was supported housing with temporary care agency staf.
This provision brake down which exsacerbated Jessie's mental health. This then led to 2
Hosptial mental inpatient admisssion.

She was taken to Derriford Hospital by ambulance in the early hours of 16 May 2021 where she was reviewed in the emergency department and then shortly afterwards admitted to ICU.
 
On arrival at the emergency department, Katie was recognised to be extremely unwell. She was unconscious with a GCS of 3 as a result of her overdose. She had also had a number of seizures on her way to the hospital, and prior to the ambulance arrival. She required intubation and ventilation to protect her airway and stabilise her condition.
 
A chest x-ray was undertaken which demonstrated evidence of an aspiration. Katie also had a temperature of 40°c on admission to the emergency department; this, and the evidence of early muscle injury, led the treating ICU team to conclude that Kate was likely to be suffering with serotonin toxicity.
 
Given the ongoing risk of serotonin toxicity, and following Toxbase advice, no infusion of the opiate drug [REDACTED was administered to Katie during days 1, 2 or 3 of her ICU admission. At this stage, the venlafaxine was felt to still to be her system, and the plan was to support Katie whilst this cleared, and to treat her evolving aspiration pneumonia with antibiotics. Where additional sedation was required remifentanil was used.
 
On day 4 of Katie‘s ICU admission (19 May 2021) a decision was made to switch the remifentanil infusion to a [REDACTED] infusion as per usual ICU practice.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
The administration of [REDACTED] from day four of Katie’s hospital admission reprecipitated her serotonin syndrome and directly contributed to her death. The Trust has recognised this and amended its sedation policy to recommend “lower risk” opiates (such as morphine) are used in patients who have taken overdoses of medications where there is a risk of serotonin syndrome / toxicity.
 
It is accepted that the way the [REDACTED] interacted in this case was unexpected, and appears to have occurred due to the particular circumstances of Katie’s case; in particular an aspiration pneumonia requiring treatment in the prone position, and the development of a paralytic ileus. However, these complications are not unusual in patients who have taken overdoses of these types of medications and as such I consider there is a risk a future death may occur in similar circumstances.
 
I am concerned that other NHS organisations may not fully appreciate the risks associated with the use of [REDACTED] in patients such as Katie and that this information should be shared with those organisations on a national level.","On 11 June 2021 an inquest was opened touching the death of Katie Anne WILLIAMS (aged 45) who died at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth on 24 May 2021.

She was found suspended [REDACTED]. The evidence indicted that she had secured the ligature herself before lowering herself into it. The evidence established that she had died at some point in the early hours of the morning – it was known that she was not sleeping. There were no suspicious circumstances concerning the death. The Deceased was diagnosed with EUPD and ADHD and was receiving therapy and support from the community mental health team and from her GP in respect of physical pain. She had been struggling in the months prior to her death with emotional dysregulation, reflective of her EUPD but influenced in part by a programme of gradual reduction in her medications, which she had requested. The evidence was not able to establish that the change in her medication had chemically caused an instability in her emotions (and it was recognised that both the long term and concomitant use of her various prescription medications were clinically indicated and without contra-indications). However, the psychological impact of reduction, coupled with increasing social stressors and an increasingly subjective feeling of isolation, abandonment and lack of being heard in the last few weeks of her life are believed to have all contributed to an increasing internal narrative which led, on the evening of 24 June 2022, and without warning, to a spontaneous and impulsive act against an increasing background of emotional dysregulation. There was no evidence to indicate that her death had been an accident or a cry of help (given the timing and nature of the act). In the context of her complex diagnosed conditions however, the risk of dangerous and impulsive acts with impulsive intent was recognised, but not in all the circumstances expected.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
1. It was recognised in evidence and in submission to the Court by representatives of the Trust, that there is and remains a fragmented relationship between mental health and physical health services, with little inter-service connectivity. It was recognised that ideally services for those with both mental and physical health diagnoses should be connecting in a seamless, timely and collaborative manner – specifically through the joint commissioning of services, to support patients of all ages.
 
Nationally it is recognised that co-morbidity, especially with ADHD (as was the case in this death), impacts on both treatment compliance and treatment response. Whilst local initiatives have been explored by SHFT and by the ICB – Project Fusion I understand is such an example – much of the development of such services falls outside of scope and commissioning. Consequently, there is a significant and pressing need for connectivity between mental health services and those services supporting neurodivergent patients.
 
It was noted in evidence e.g. that SHFT do not currently have a comorbidity policy that would provide guidance to staff regarding patients who have a mental health condition and a learning difficulty. There are no ADHD services within SHFT or other NHS organisations within the Southampton (or in fact the wider Hampshire) area – save for private clinics, which many cannot afford.
 
The facts in this case have highlighted that progress on initiatives and connectivity between services is still too little and too slow. More needs to be done, and with greater integration, if the needs and support of patients such as Kirsty Taylor are to be sufficiently and appropriately met in the future and similar deaths prevented.
 
2. Evidence before this inquest indicated that SHFT has recognised that the mental health provision for those with personality disorders must move towards an individual, therapeutic and trauma-informed approached, which is both compassionate and recovery focused. It is evident that the ‘Personality Disorder Pathway’ currently being developed is an important step towards that, enabling practitioners and services to take a more holistic and person-centred approach, reducing risk and improving outcomes. I am aware that SHFT have been encouraged to review and further develop the Pathway. I am concerned that that must occur, and at pace.
 
3. I remain concerned (as it is a matter I have raised on many occasions at inquest and again as a result of the experiences of the family in this case), that communication with the families of patients with mental health difficulties is still not being effectively achieved. Nor are such families being suffiently, effectively and meaningfuly listened to or understood when they voice concerns, based on their experience of the patient outside of a treatement or assessment environment. Consequently, I am concerned that such matters are not being reflected sufficiently or frequently enough in the onward treatment of those patients or in the clinical curiosity afforded to their conditions.
 
There remains an over-focus on patient centric assessments and patient only responses. It is recognised that patients can present quite differently to and in the presence of their families, who know them intimately, to how they may (or may be able to) present to assessing clinicians – with or without the intent to mask their condition.",On 04 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Kirsty Clare TAYLOR aged 33. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 09 June 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that the Deceased impulsively took her own life (by hanging) whilst suffering increased emotional dysregulation against a background of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder.,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 17 October 2023. I, the coroner, may extend the period.
 
Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise, you must explain why no action is proposed.","I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013.","ee

‘change in her medication had chemically caused an instablty in her emotions (and it was
Fecognised that bath the long term and concomitant use of her various prescription
medications were clinically indicated and without contra-indcations). However, the
psychological Impact of reduction, coupled with increasing social stressors and an increasingly

expected

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course ofthe investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In
my opinion there isa sk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the
Groumstances feis my statutory duty to report to you

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are 2 fllows:

1 was recognised in evidence and in submission tothe Court by representatives of
the Trust, that there is and remains a fragmented relationship between mental heath
‘and physical health services, with tle inter-service connectivity. It was recognised
{hat idealy services for those with both mental and physical health diagnoses should
be connecting na seamless, timely and collaborative manner ~ specifically through
the joint commissioning of services, to support patents ofall ages.

Nationally i is recognised that co-morbidity, especially with ADHD (as was the case in
this death), Impacts an both treatment compliance and treatment response. Whilst
local itiatives have been explored by SHFT and by the ICB - Project Fusion I
understand is such an example ~ much ofthe development of such services falls,
‘outside af scope and commissioning. Consequently, there Isa significant and pressing
need for connectivity betwaen mental health services and those services supporting
eurodivergent patents.

I was noted in evidence e.g that SHET de not currently have @ comorbidity policy
that would provide guidance to staff regarding patients who have a mental heath
conaltion anda learning dificlty. There are no ADHD services within SHFT or other
[NHS organisations within the Southampton (orn fact the wider Hampshire) area ~
save for private cies, which many cannot afford

‘The facts inthis case have highlighted that progress on initiatives and connectivity
between eervces ie stil too lite and too slew. More needs to be dane, and ith
‘greater integration, if the needs and support of patients such as Kirsty Taylor are to
Se suftciently and appropriately met in te future ang similar deathe prevented

Evidence before ths inquest indicated that SHFT has recognised thatthe mental
health provision for those with personality disarders must move towards an
Individual, therapeutic and trauma-infarmed approached, which is both
compassionate and recovery focused. It ls evident thatthe ""Personally Disorder
Pathway’ currently Being daveloped fs an Important step towards tat, enabling
practitioners and servies to take more holistic and person-centred approach,
Feducing isk and improving outcomes. 1am aware that SHFT have been encouraged
to review and further develop the Pathway. Lam concermed that that must occur, and
at pace.

[remain concemed (as it sa matter I have raised on many occasions at inquest and
‘again at 3 result ofthe experiences ofthe family in this case), that communication
‘nth the families of patients with mental health wifcltos is all not being effectively
‘Bhievad, Nor are such familes being sufienty, effectively and meaningful listened
{0 or understood whan they voice concerns, based an thelr experience of the patient
butzide of» treatement or sessment environment, Consequenty, lam concemed
{that such matters are not being reflected sufcientiy or frequently enough inthe
‘onward treatment of those patents or in th clinical curiosity afforded to thelr
onaitions,

‘There remains an over-focus on patient centric assessments and patient only
responses. Its recognised that patents ean present quite dferenty to and in the
presence of thelr families, who know them intimately, ta how they may (or may be
ble to) present to assessing clinicians - with or without the intent to mask thelr
Eendition

Whilst consent to share i an understandable barrier in some cases, there should not
be a bart listening to a to actively encouraging feedback and input from families,
‘especially where 2 family’s concems are heightened By any sudden or marked
‘changes Inthe behaviours, mood or presentation oftheir relative outside ofthe
Cnicalfassessment environment - particularly inthe case of neurodiversity

Unless all concerns are heard and considered and all availble information is taken on
board, holistealy there isa continuing risk that the masking of mental health
Conditions and the deterioration af them may occur or that significant red lags are
missed. In this case, the family’s increasingly desperate concerns voiced about thelr
‘daughter's evident mental neath detenoration in her nal days went un-responde.

4. Finally, 1am concemed that more needs to be done to inform and assist families,
particularly in cases of patients with neurodiversty. In this particular cas, the
‘evidence found, for example, thatthe family were never briefed on what EUPD and
[ADHD really meant or onthe effculties whieh could presant as a result of ther
‘daughter's joint clagnoses. Being unaware as to what they were to expect, they were
onsequetnly often ata loss to know how to interact with orto help her Neither they
nor their daughter recelvee advice on possible medication withdrawal symptoms.

‘The conclusion of the inquest was suicide, the medical cause of death being:

1a drowning

| CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

(1) Me Whitelaw had was known to mental health services at Oxleas NHS
Foundation Trust prir to his death

(2) He was detained by police for his own safety, using their powers under
section 136 of the Mental Health Act 1983, on 7 January 2023 having
twice attempted suicide on that day. Having been treated in hospital
(predominantly for his physical health as a result of the suicide
attempts) between 7 ~ 12 January 2023, he was thereafter admitted to
the Shrewsbury Ward in Oxleas House on an informal basis for care
and suppor in relation to his mental health. He was discharged to the
Greenwich Home Treatment Team, folowing an assessment by them
con 25 January 2023.

@) His mood and mental health deteriorated significantly in late-January
and early-February 2023. This deterioration was documented and
noted by numerous individual clinicians, but they focussed on Mr
Whitelaw’s presentation in the moment, without reference to past
notes or full consideration of past risk factors.

(4) On 2 February 2023, Mr Whitelaw was seen by a psychologist. During
the appointment he disclosed that he would be wiling to accept a
further informal admission to hospital. At the conclusion of that
appointment, the psychologist made a verbal referral of Mr Whitelaw to
another clinician for urgent medical review by a psychiatrist. That
referral was not acted on and, as such, Mr Whitelaw was not re~
admitted to hospital on an informal basis, or otherwise.

(8) On 14 February 2023, Mr Whitelaw's wife reported to the police that
Luke Whitelaw was missing. A missing person investigation was
conducted

(6) On 17 March 2023, the Marine Policing Unit responded to reports of a
body in the river Thames. They recovered a body, which was
subsequently identified as Mr Luke Whitelaw.

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS:

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to
concer. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless
action is taken. In the circumstances, itis my statutory duty to report to you,

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:-

(1) Mr Lockwood's re-admission to hospital was indicated as early as 2
February 2023; however, he was not re-admitted to hospital, informally
or otherwise.

(2) A verbal referral was made for Mr Whitelaw to be urgently reviewed by
psychiatrist following the appointment on 2 February 2023, but not
acted on

(8) The Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust's Serious Incident Investigation
Report, dated 8 September 2023, identified numerous matters and
learning points, including, but not limited to the following:

‘+ There had been a lack of “professional curiosity’ in the
assessment and planning of Mr Whitelaw's care and treatment

‘+ ""Discussions and assessments of risk should be clearly
documented""

‘+ ""Risk formulations should consider both current and
historic/contextual risks and incorporate ratings of mood to
ensure that these are not used in isolation and are linked with
appropriate interventions”

‘+ There were “missed opportunities identified in relation to LW's,
self-reported deterioration following his discharge from hospital
which do not appear to have been fully explored.”

However, the Serious Incident Investigation Report does include
any plan to address the concerns it identified. As such, there

insufficient reassurance that there is plan to address the matters in
‘a meaningful way moving forward

CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS

| make this report under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009,
paragraph 7, Schedule 5, and The Coroners (Investigations)
Regulations 2013, regulations 28 and 29.

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(On 27 March 2023 an investigation was commenced into the death of
Mohammed Zeeshan Akram, date of birth 22 November 1993. The
investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 6 September 2023,
‘The conclusion was suicide. The medical cause of death was 1a
multiorgan failure; 1b, acute ethylene glycol toxicity; 2. mental health
disorder.

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Zee had a history of suicidal ideation and reported suicide attempts
dating back to his childhood. In February 2019 he was diagnosed with
‘a psychotic disorder. He received suppor for his mental health from the
Crisis Team in 2019 and spent two days as a mental health inpatient.

In December 2022 Zee reported panic attacks and auditory
hallucinations. He was taken on by the Crisis Team who prescribed
ciazepam, zopiclone, olanzapine and fluoxetine. On 30 December
there was a joint review by the Home Treatment Team and Haringey
(BEH) Early intervention Service (EIS) at St Ann's Hospital and Zee
was allocated a care coordinator. On 30 December Zee was

discharged from the Home Treatment Team who wrote asking the GP
to continue repeating his medications which were zopiclone a

olanzapine fg, fluoxetine jg and diazepam mm

In February 2023 Zee's mental health deteriorated. On 16 February he
reported EIS that he was experiencing negative side effects from his
‘medication but that he felt mostly optimistic. He requested a reduction
of olanzapine.

‘There was an exchange of text messages between Zee and a dual
diagnosis recovery worker between 17 February and 18 March in which
Zee appeared upbeat, said that he was attending work and gave no
‘cause for the recovery worker to be concerned.

(On 16 March Zee attended an appointment and informed his recovery
worker that he had stopped taking his olanzapine and fluoxetine 2
weeks previously due fo numbness that had led to suicidal ideation,
The recovery worker went out of his way to arrange an urgent medical
review for Monday 20 March. Zee was given safety netting advice,

‘After this appointment, Zee went to NNN where he spent
several hours contemplating throwing himself into the Thames. He did
rot inform his recovery worker of this or contact the crisis team.

(On Friday 17 March the recovery worker sent Zee a text message with
the appointment for a medical review on Monday 20 March. Zee replied
that he was unable to make the appointment as he was working on the
Monday and so the appointment was rearranged for Tuesday 21

March

(On 20 March Zee did not attend work. A friend went to his flat and
found Zee unresponsive. Zee was taken to the Whittington Hospital
where he died on 21 March 2023.

CORONER'S CONCERNS.

During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving
rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur
unless action is taken. In the circumstances, itis my statutory duty to
report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows,

| heard evidence that there was no routine mechanism to cross reference
what people are prescribed and what medication they are actually
collecting, and no automatic notification to GPs who are responsible for
the medication prescribing. Zee informed BEH that he had not taken his
olanzapine and fluoxetine for two weeks. His GP, who was prescribing
that medication, was not informed.

| am concemed that GPs are not updated, particularly where patients
have expressed suicidal ideation, and may not be aware that people are
rot taking medication andlor that there may be a risk of stockpiling,

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and |
believe that your organisation has the power to take such action.

YOUR RESPONSE

You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date
of this report, namely by 22 January 2024. |, the coroner, may extend
the period

Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be
taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain
why no action is proposed.

Whilst in the community Mr Huntley had been under the care of Steps to Wellbeing for PTSD and anxiety. He had disclosed daily suicidal thoughts to them with no intent to act upon these thoughts. The recall notification of the 22/5/20 stated that Mr Huntley reported low mood and claimed to want to take his own life but was not brave enough to do so. This information from the recall notice was not recorded in the record keeping system which could be accessed by all prison security staff (NOMIS).
 
Mr Huntley denied thoughts of suicide or self-harm when asked by the police on the 23/02/2020. During the reception process at HMP Winchester he denied thoughts of suicide or self-harm.
 
On the 25/05/2020 Mr Huntley called for help [REDACTED]. He later disclosed that this had been a planned act with the intent to end his own life. He had taken steps to avoid being discovered and had only called for help when he awoke [REDACTED].
                                                                                   .
Mr Huntley was subsequently taken to hospital and discharged later the same morning. Having left hospital he collapsed and was admitted to the Healthcare wing of the prison for observations.
 
An ACCT document was opened. This is a way of monitoring persons in custody who are at risk of harm. During previous periods of imprisonment in 2010 and 2016 ACCT documents had been opened for Mr Huntley. These documents were not contained within in core records as should have been the case and still cannot be located. Their existence, and the circumstances of the 2016 ACCT, were recorded on NOMIS.
 
Mr Huntley was initially placed on 30-minute observations when the 2023 ACCT was opened, this was reduced to hourly observations after the first case review on the 25/05/2020 and then to 3 random observations overnight after the second case review on the 27/05/2020. These changes were made following assessment meetings involving Mr Huntley, prison staff and staff from the NHS Trust providing physical and mental health interventions within the prison.
 
Mr Huntley denied further thoughts of self-harm or suicide during these meetings.
On the 28/05/2020 Mr Huntley was moved from his original cell in the healthcare wing to cell
13. Cell 13 was located in the area of the healthcare unit primarily used for patients with mental health difficulties. Apart from cells 6 and 13 all of the cells in this area were designed to have reduced ligature points. However in 2019 telephone points had been installed in each of these cells which protruded from the wall. The decision to move Mr Huntley was made at a Multi-disciplinary meeting at which no-one who had met Mr Huntley to assess his mental health was present.
 
On the evening of the 28/05/20 the night duty prison officer completed their rounds at approximately 20.30 and noted that Mr Huntley was sat on the floor of his cell in a partial blind spot. Between 21.00 and 21.30 the nurse on duty knocked on Mr Huntley’s cell door and received a verbal response.
 
At about 23.30 the prison officer attended to complete the first observations required under the ACCT document for Mr Huntley. They saw that Mr Huntley was in the same position as some 3 hours earlier and Mr Huntley did not respond to him. The officer entered the cell with other prison officers at about 23.35 and found Mr Huntley sat motionless [REDACTED].
 
The prison officers cut the ligature and commenced CPR. An emergency call was put out and further prison officers and both on-duty nurses attended. Those present provided CPR to Mr Huntley until the arrival of paramedics. Sadly despite the efforts of staff and the attending medics Mr Huntley could not be revived and his life was declared extinct.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
ACCT documents
In evidence at the inquest ACCT assessors and case managers accepted that they had not complied with various mandatory actions required under PSI 64/2011: Managing Prisoner Safety in Custody. They were not able to identify in evidence the risk factors it was mandatory to consider for persons at risk of suicide or self-harm. They had not recorded triggers in the relevant section of the ACCT nor recorded all risk factors in the Caremap section. One ACCT case manager stated that they did not know whether it was necessary to record a trigger if action had been taken to mitigate it. They also stated they categorised risk based on ‘remaining’ risk after action had been taken despite having not recorded the trigger.
 
This leads me to have 2 concerns:
The first regards the provision and quality of ACCT training and refresher training given this evidence was given some 2 years after the death of Mr Huntley and well after the disruptions brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic.
 
I also heard evidence that despite an ACCT being a ‘whole prison’ document (which can and should be opened by any member of staff) training was not mandatory for non-security staff.
In 2019 there was no joint training for prison and heathcare staff on the use of ACCT documents. I am informed by CNWL that under ACCT v6 (which has been in force since July 2021) joint training is provided for and this is reassuring. However I understand that the frequency of this training is determined in relation to operational capacity at individual establishment level. This is of concern given the evidence from witnesses at this inquest some 20 months after this version came into force.
 
The second relates to the quality and effectiveness of ACCT audits. We heard evidence that ACCT documents are reviewed annually. The case manager mentioned above advised that he had not received any adverse feedback about the quality of his ACCT documents and no issues with them had been identified. Given the inadequate nature of the ACCT document opened on Mr Huntley and apparent lack of understanding about completing the documents the quality of the audits is brought into question.
 
Information sharing.
In evidence it was clear that the ACCT document was the only written document used for sharing information between the healthcare staff employed by the NHS trust and the prison security staff. Healthcare staff record and share their information within SystemOne which the prison security staff do not have access to. Prison security staff record information within NOMIS which healthcare staff do not have access to.
 
Evidence from witnesses revealed that these information systems are not necessarily fully reviewed for relevant information prior to attending ACCT meetings.
 
In addition a decision relating to Mr Huntley’s care (i.e. the move to a different cell) was taken by healthcare staff at their own meeting when they did not have the benefit of information available to prison staff.
 
[REDACTED] of HMP Winchester informed me that a Safety Intervention Meeting was now carried out weekly, chaired by a Senior Governor and attended by representatives of the prison, physical and mental health care providers and the probation service. This meeting covers each person subject to an ACCT and any relevant information is share via the ACCT case manager, NOMIS and the multi disciplinary team. [REDACTED] could not assist me with whether this was a HMP Winchester initiative or had a wide application across the prison estate.
 
My concern is therefore that the current procedures and policies for sharing information are incomplete or not fully complied with. This renders the information on which separate teams make decisions about a prisoner incomplete and increases the risk that important factors are not considered.
 
Cells
At HMP Winchester within the area, considered and referred to by most healthcare and prison staff, as the ‘mental health’ cells there are 2 cells which are not equipped in a way to reduce the amount of available ligature points.
 
It was clear from the evidence of the healthcare staff at the MDT meeting on the 28/05/2020 that they did not consider the contents of the cell when deciding to move Mr Huntley to the ‘mental health cells’ simply due to the fact he was on an ACCT. I heard evidence that the policy of CNWL has now changed and that a cell move risk assessment must now be carried out and that there is now a revised ligature audit process. HMP Winchester informed me that there is now an annual ligature audit carried out in conjunction with the new healthcare provider at that establishment. In addition I was informed that all telephone points in the ‘mental health cells’ at HMP Winchester have now been removed and placed outside the cells. These are welcome developments.
 
However at inquest those representing the HMPPS could not inform me whether all telephone points within cells designed for use by those at risk of self harm across the prison estate had been removed. Nor was any evidence available as to what consideration had been given to reducing the risk of the telephone points by design of the points themselves or the manner of their installation. Those representing were invited to provide this information after the hearing but have not done so.
 
I am concerned that telephone points which provide a ligature point may remain within cells which prison and health care staff consider to be suitable for use by those at risk of self harm.
 
The final area of concern is the lack of certified Safer Cells at HMP Winchester. The inquest heard evidence that these had either never existed at HMP Winchester or had not done so for many years. The evidence from prison governors was that, generally speaking within the prison estate, they were not used or proved too hard to maintain to the certified standard. However certified Safer Cells are still referred to in PSI 64/2011 as a means of managing risk from ligatures. It was heard in evidence that HMP Winchester experience high levels of self-harm and suicide and yet it did not appear that consideration had been given recently to introducing these. Those representing the HMPSS at the were invited to provide information about the status and use of safer certified cells across the prison estate. No such information has been forthcoming.","On 02 June 2020 an investigation was commenced into the death of Thomas Victor HUNTLEY (aged 54) who had died in HMP Winchester. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 05 April 2023. The inquest, which was held with a jury, ended with a narrative conclusion.   ",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by July 09, 2023. I, the coroner, may extend the period.
 
Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed.","I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013.","Regulation 28: REPORT TO PREVENT FUTURE DEATHS

Although not formally diagnosed with a mental health illness, at the time of their death clinicians were considering a working diagnosis of mood disorder depression of a severe nature. Madeleine had a very significant history of periodic suicidal ideation and a history of self-harm, the risk of both becoming acute in early February 2022. Madeleine was known to the Child and Young Persons Mental Health Service and to the Paediatric Ward at Ipswich Hospital. All organisations concerned with Madeleine’s care had knowledge of their history of suicidal ideation.
 
On the 3rd February 2022 Madeleine absconded undetected from their school and carried out an act of self-harm which resulted in their hospitalisation. They were subsequently identified as needing a Tier 4 Bed admission on a paediatric mental health ward. Measures were put in place for such a bed to be sourced. At the time of Madeleine’s death a bed was neither identified nor allocated to Madeleine.
 
During Madeleines admission on Bergholt Ward at Ipswich Hospital they were assessed as being a high risk of self-harm. Their mood fluctuated and on occasions Madeleine presented with no indication of either suffering from low mood or suicidal ideation.
Throughout this period of time Madeleine’s presentation was complex and reflected the working diagnosis of mood disorder depression of a severe nature. A risk assessment on the 12th February 2022 identified the need for additional measures in managing Madeleine’s risk which included mental health observations. These measures were ceased on or around the 14th February 2022. The rationale behind why these measures were ceased is unclear.
 
On the 19th February 2022, during the evening Bergholt Ward shift, Madeleine appeared settled and an earlier episode of distress during the day seemed to have no further impact on them. At around 22:05 pm Madeleine made their way to the bathroom securing the door behind them. They were not observed by ward staff entering the bathroom and there was a period of up to ten minutes during which Madeleine’s precise whereabouts was unknown. At around 22:20 pm the evening shift Nurse-in-Charge on Bergholt Ward was informed that Madeleine had been in the bathroom for at least ten minutes and was concerned that this period of time was longer than expected. Measures taken to rouse Madeleine by knocking on the door or calling out to them produced no response. Staff subsequently entered the bathroom and found that Madeleine had ligatured themself.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
Initial referral – there seems to be a gap at the initial referral and admission stage in obtaining information about and recording previous methods of self-harm and suicide. There also appears to be a gap in the seeking and recording of relevant information from an individual’s family at the point of referral and admission. An individual’s family is often able to provide detailed and useful information about events that may not have been previously reported and/or be able to bridge the gap in communications between various health agencies involved in someone’s care.
 
Access to notes – the other concerning issue is the difficulty prevalent within the private sector in the accessing of NHS notes. It appears to be the position across the private sector that access to an individual’s notes is not provided as standard. This means that there may be a significant gap in the information available when someone is admitted to a premises run by a private healthcare provider, even within an NHS allocated bed. This gap in information can have an impact on an individual’s risk assessment and their subsequent care plan.",On 19 May 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Christopher Richard ALLUM aged 36.

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to
concern. In my opinion there isa risk that future deaths could occur unless
action is taken. Inthe circumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

(2) During evidence the matter of monitoring people who attend the bridge
in mental health distress was raised. There isa minimum of 2 staff in the
control room and 3 staff covering “traffic duties” on the ground. The
security staff at the bridge deal with a variety of security issues however
this report only seeks to address theie role in relation to those suffering
from mental health distress, The staff are expected to identify and
‘monitor any person of concern entering the walkways of the bridge.

This involves looking at their actions, mannerisms, behaviour and body
language. Staff are expected to identify those who may require
assistance and contact staffing colleagues to approach them
‘appeared there was no structured training policy in place to ensure
that staf are given appropriate training to deal with identifying
vulnerable people. On joining, staff have an & weeks mentoring course,
whereby an experienced colleague shows them the role and advises on
What to look for. Staff may also undertake an on line suicide prevention
course and mental health first aid at work as well as safety
hharness/working at height training. However there appeared to be no
structure to any of the training for ths vital role and of more concern
there was no input from a trained medical professional with significant

without appropriate and structured input from a health care
professional, any experience on the job is based on unstable
foundations. it was evident that the role is vitally Important in
Identifying those at risk and seeking the appropriate help. Without
receiving knowledge from someone trained in mental health, having a
substantive input on negotiation and how to interact with those in crisis
then the dificult ob of assessing people and reacting appropriately with
them becomes very difficult.

(2} While the ""Right Care/Right Person” process appears to ensure that the
correct emergency service should respond if called, delays in response

‘means often staff are left dealing with a vulnerable person for many

hours due to unavailability of emergency services or mental health

support.

Mr Gale was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. Mr Gale was seen regularly by mental health professionals and was in frequent contact with mental health services. Those services were provided by Cumbria, Northumberland Tyne & Wear NHS Foundation Trust (“the Trust”). Mr Gale was compliant with his medication and engaged with services. He was well supported by his family and friends.
 
Mr Gale’s anxiety continued during his engagement with mental health services. Evidence was heard about what caused Mr Gale’s anxiety. One ongoing feature was his application for Universal Credit.
 
On 2 March 2023, 2 days before his death, Mr Gale was seen by an Associate Specialist Psychiatrist, who gave evidence at the inquest. The Psychiatrist considered Mr Gale’s anxiety was exacerbated by his application for Universal Credit. During Mr Gale’s appointment, the Psychiatrist called the benefits office for help but the call was not answered before the end of the consultation. Mr Gale was expecting a call from a DWP representative the next day (3 March).
 
On 3 March 2022 at approximately 11:00 am, Mr Gale spoke to the duty Registered Mental Health Nurse. He remained very anxious and his main concern was the application for Universal Credit.
 
During their evidence, the Associate Specialist Psychiatrist expressed concerns about the experience of mental health service users with DWP. These concerns were not just specific to Mr Gale.
 
Evidence was also given by the Trust’s Group Nurse Director (a Registered Mental Health Nurse) who considered that the issues identified by the Psychiatrist were national. The Director considered it important to address these issues as they were debilitating for service users.
 
The Director advised that the Trust’s Crisis Team had started a food bank 3 years ago to support service users. The Director was also aware that the DWP had been invited to the Cumbria Suicide Prevention Group.
 
I stress that I did not make a causal link between Mr Gale’s death and his anxiety about his Universal Credit application. DWP was not an Interested Person in Mr Gale’s inquest and did not give evidence as the concerns raised did not come to light until the hearing.","The evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Current DWP procedures may not be practical for those with mental health illness and can exacerbate symptoms. I heard evidence that:
 
1.     The number of and length of DWP forms required to be completed can be overwhelming for someone with a mental health illness. This is perpetuated if the applicant cannot get help to complete the paperwork.
2.     There are long telephone queues to speak to a DWP advisor.

|I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, ofthe Coroners and Justice
‘Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 ofthe Coroners (Investigations) Regulations
2013.

J | INVESTIGATION and INQUEST
(On 16 April 2021 an investigation was commenced into the death of Eric
Sebastian Huber. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest held on
10 October 2023. The conclusion ofthe inquest was as follows:

Evie Sebastian Huber was known to suffer with his mental heaith and was

‘considered to be vulnerable. On 1 April 2021 Mr Huber was discovered
‘deceased hanging He died due
to selinflicted suspension

ric Sebastian Huber died as a consequence of his own actions.

| CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

[Mr Huber had a tong history of drug and alcohol use dating back to 2008. — he
also had a long history of depression and anxiely. He had been managed
intermittently by the community mental heath services.

[Mr Huber was considered vulnerable and at risk of exploitation and harm from
others ~ he was known to the safeguarding team at Devon County Council
(OCC) and the safeguarding team at Devon and Comwall Police.

His vulnerability was felt to be due to alcohol, chronic mental health problems
{general self-neglect and to his ongoing misuse of drugs and risk of ‘cuckooing”
from convicted drug dealers.

In October 2019 a safeguarding enquiry was commenced and allocated to a
case worker at DCC to follow up witha visit to establish their views and risks
and discuss with the police. The case worker spoke with police officer who had
sseen Mr Huber that day ~ the officer reported that Mr Huber was fine, he was
attending AA meetings regularly and coping much better - the case worker did
‘ot follow up directly with Mr Huber and did not assess Mr Huber.

Tn Seplember 2020 there was a further safeguarding concern raised to DCC by
the police as his flat was being used to sell drugs by two individuals staying
there — an activity known as cuckooing. The police requested a review of Mr
Huber’s care and support needs.

(On 13 October 2020 this was allocated to the same caseworker as previously

(On 18 October 2020 Further concerns were raised with DCC around 2
individuals intimidating Mr Huber.

There is no written record in the DCC care frst record system of action taken by
the case worker in response to these concems.

From the records it appears that there is no evidence of a Care Act assessment,
‘multi-agency discussion meeting or consideration or Mr Huber’ situation and
how to manage the risk from drug dealers at this stage.

(On 24 November 2020 Mr Huber himself called the DCC Adult Social Care
Direct via its call centre to ask for support there is no record of this message
boing followed up by the team manager or the social worker.

(On 3 December 2020 a fiend of Mr Huber rang DCC Adult Social Care Direct to.
raise concerns over cuckooing and bullying of Mr Huber and that he was
struggling to cope.

The case worker called Mr Huber on 7 December 2020 and discussed help with
his drug and alcohol use and enabler assist to help with household matters — the
case worker noted that he would contact the police for an update. There is no
record ofa cal tothe police.

(On 8 December 2020 the safeguarding enquiry was closed with the outcome
thatthe immediate risks were adequately addressed and that it was a
proportionate response to reallocate for a full assessment of needs.

‘There is no record of that full assessment taking place.
(On 15 January 2021 a police report was received by Devon Adult Social Care
Direct call-centre there are no records of any contacts or discussions arising
from this police contact.

The case was closed on 3 March 2021 ~ at ths time there had been no
assessment of his needs.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

‘The inquest heard evidence of the distress caused to Holly and the
impact on her health by the long waits to be seen by gastroenterologists
and gynaecologists within the NHS. The evidence heard was that post-
Covid, the waiting times to be seen in both specialties unless the referral

was on the two-week cancer wait had grown significantly across England
{As an illustration the inquest was told that pre-Covid, the average wait for
a routine gynaecology referral was 18 weeks. Now in England the wait
‘was often in excess of 12 months. Even an urgent referral would often
involve a wait of over 40 weeks. This was leading to delays in diagnosis,
and treatment even in those with significant/severe health conditions.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
(1)  The serious incident investigation by the Trust has been substantially delayed. Sarah died on the 10th of July 2022 and the Trust confirmed to the Coroner’s service that there was to be a serious incident investigation on the 26th July 2022. The serious incident investigation remained unallocated and with no timeframe for completion for over 7 months and on the 13th of March 2023 as this remained the position I listed this case for Inquest on the 24th of April 2023. On the 17th April 2023 I was alerted by deceased’s family to possible progress in respect of the serious incident investigation in this case, subsequent to their formal complaint to the Trust. After making enquiries of the Trust I was informed that the report would be available at the end of May 2023 and I therefore acceded to a family request to adjourn the final hearing given the short delay this would cause. On the 25th of April 2023 the Coronial service was informed that in fact that it was unlikely that the report would be finalised by May and would be’ likely end of July/August time’. On the 26th of June I was informed that the report would now not be available until the ‘end of September/beginning of October’ and that the initial dates given were “too ambitious”. The case was listed to commence on the 16th of November 2023 on that basis. On the 28th of July the deceased’s family notified me of a likely further delay in the report being available due to the author’s sick leave from work. The Trust offered reassurance that the report remained due ‘end of September/beginning of October’. On the 28th of September a Pre Inquest Review Hearing was held in relation to a separate discrete issue and I was informed that the report was to be further delayed and would not be available until the end of October.
 
(2)  The NHS framework sets out clearly a timescale of 60 working days for the completion of investigation reports and highlights the importance of working in an open, honest and transparent way. One of the key underpinning principles in the management of all serious incidents is that they should be timely and responsive. The purpose of the investigation is to ensure that weaknesses in a system or process are identified to understand what went wrong, how it went wrong and what can be done to prevent similar incidents occurring again.
 
(3)  If the final version report is received by the end of October it will be some 15 months since Sarah’s death and some 13 months outside the NHS framework. This is neither timely nor responsive.
 
(4)  I have previously issued a PFD report in relation to this issue as has the Senior Coroner for Durham and Darlington, Mr Chipperfield, who stated that Tees Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust routinely fails, to employ, in a timely way, nationally recognised process and procedure designed to prevent avoidable death. In permitting delay of “serious incident” investigations, TEWV may: (i) permit lethal hazard to persist for longer than necessary; and (ii) compromise the quality of such investigations and hence their value in preventing avoidable deaths.

On 7th May 2022 Mr Donoghue was taken by police to Miranda House (a place of support for mental health) after he attended the Humber Bridge with the intention to end his life.

During May 2022 Scott spoke about hanging himself to his partner, [REDACTED]. 
 
The HBTT conducted a series of visits while he awaited a date to be moved to the Community Mental Health Team where he would have had one person having oversight of his care.
 
Due to the need for 24 hour a day/7 days a week HBTT service, the court heard that continuity of care by either one person or a small group of people was not possible. Mr Donoghue raised concerns on more than one occasion about the lack of continuity of the people overseeing his care, he specifically told them that he could sometimes put on a front with new faces to make him look okay when he was actually struggling.

Scott James DONOGHUE had a history of anxiety but in 2022 developed
depression. He came under the care of the Home Based Mental Health Team

May 2022. Mr Donoghue agreed to engage with HBTT and was awaiting an

raised his concern at the lack of continuity of staff that were assigned to
oversee his care plan. He specifically told HBTT that he would sometimes put

| CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

‘Mr Donoghue was an intelligent and high achieving individual who was part of a
loving relationship. He had a history of anxiety but developed depression
following the loss of his mother through suicide in January 2022, some
childhood issues and frustrations over the care of his young poorly daughter.

He had made previous attempts to end his life including using a ligature 4 years
previously, an overdose on 28/02/2022, overdose attempts in April 2022.

(n 7% May 2022 Mr Donoghue was taken by police to Miranda House (a place
of support for mental health) after he attended the Humber Bridge with the
Intention to end his life. Mr Donoghue indicated to staff at Miranda House that
he wanted help; he was assessed, did not want admission and opted for being
treated by the Home Based Treatment Team (HBTT)

During May 2022 Scott spoke about hanging himself to his partner

The HBTT conducted a series of visits while he awaited a date to be moved to
the Community Mental Health Team where he would have had one person
hhaving oversight of his care.

ue to the need for 24 hour a day/7 days a week HBTT service, the court heard
that continuity of care by either one person or a small group of people was not
possible. Mr Donoghue raised concerns on more than one occasion about the
lack of continuity of the people overseeing his care, he specially told them
that he could sometimes put on a front with new faces to make him look okay
When he was actually struggling.

‘Mr Donoghue used a ligature and hanged himself at his home on 24° May
2022.

3 | CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to
concern. In my opinion there isa risk that future deaths could occur unless
action is taken. Inthe circumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ~

(2) It was evident that the lack of consistency in staff dealing with Me
Donoghue’s care was a factor in his ability to engage and be honest with
those having oversight of him at a very fragile time in his treatment.

(2) Evidence was heard that the HBTT system isa nationwide treatment as

‘an alternative to hospital admission and although peoples’ care in HBTT
hhad improved, areal continuity of staff could only occur with a
substantive change which would include adgitional funding, recruitment
of appropriate staff and an ability to retain staff. | was informed that if
these issues were addressed it would allow more capacity to manage
consistency alongside the other demands of the service.
It is worthy of note that this is the 2"" inquest heard within 3 weeks in
this jurisdiction whereby inconsistency of care staff has been cited as an
Issue in a suicide. The other inquest was the death of a20 year old
(4) Mental Health is a rising problem and it is my understanding that 115
people die by suicide every week. Acknowledgement ofthe important
work undertaken by HBTT and the need to give the very best support to
those who have taken the, often dificult, step of seeking help with their
care isa matter that requires imminent attention.

",1077,"1. Lack of continuity in staff overseeing Mr. Donoghue's care hindered his ability to engage and receive the best level of care.
2. The HBTT system lacks real continuity of staff, which is necessary for effective treatment, and addressing this issue requires additional funding, recruitment of appropriate staff, and staff retention.
3. Inconsistency of care staff has been cited as an issue in multiple suicide cases within a short period of time in this jurisdiction.
4. Mental health is a rising problem, with a high suicide rate, and it is crucial to provide the best support to those seeking help.","Scott James Donoghue, a 33-year-old man with a history of anxiety and depression, hanged himself at his home on May 24, 2022.

He had made multiple previous suicide attempts, including a very serious previous suicide attempt of hanging.  He had previously been arrested in December 2020 and assessed by Liaison & Diversion services whilst in Police custody. After he was remanded in custody, he was placed on an ACCT twice in prison. After his release from prison on 14th February 2021, he was referred to the community Mental Health Crisis service by his GP and also had another very recent suicide attempt in the form of an overdose of anti- depressants about a week before he was again arrested on 17th March 2021. In Police custody, he was seen by a Custodial Nurse Practitioner (CNP) who had very limited training in Mental Health and the recognition of the risk of suicide. The CNP was working alone and not alongside a doctor. The CNP assessed Jack’s risk as low. The CNP also did not refer him to Liaison & Diversion services, which the jury found that probably contributed to Jack’s death. A Forensic Medical Examiner in Police custody subsequently
assessed Jack’s risk as high. Jack was again remanded in custody. Despite Jack’s significant risk history as well as other significant risk factors, such as being young, withdrawing from alcohol and early days in custody, no ACCT was opened by prison or healthcare staff, who were overly reassured by Jack’s presentation.  An agency healthcare member of staff had no training in the ACCT process. The jury found that the failure to open an ACCT by prison and healthcare staff probably contributed to Jack’s death and that, on the balance of probability, the risk of suicide was not adequately identified for Jack. These findings by the jury were based on the over-emphasis by prison and healthcare staff on Jack’s presentation against clear and evidenced previous suicide and self-harm risks and attempts, which were available to relevant police, prison and healthcare staff. The Court heard evidence that 65% of primary care healthcare staff in prison are agency staff. The Home Office circular from 2003 relating to the use of Custodial Nurse Practitioners refers working alongside doctors and being specifically trained for their role. However, the Circular makes no mention of assessing the risk of suicide or self-harm in its Annex which lists competencies.","During the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
1.       The use of Custodial Nurse Practitioners (CNPs) in Police custody instead of doctors. The 2003 Home Office circular appeared to envisage nurses working alongside doctors, when this is not how they are deployed. CNPs are also seeing high risk and complex patients without adequate training in mental health. The deployment in Police custody of CNPs places detained persons at risk of death in the future. The 2003 Home Office circular also does not recognise the risk of suicide and self-harm as being a core competency.
 
2.       The training of agency staff in the ACCT process and recognising the appropriate threshold to open an ACCT. The training of agency staff in ACCT does not appear to be part of the commissioning process by NHS England and individual providers do not appear to provide training to agency staff in the ACCT process. This places residents in prison at risk of death, given the high level of usage of agency healthcare staff in prison.","An investigation was commenced into the death of Jack Peter Zarrop, aged 23. The investigation concluded on 29 September 2023. The conclusion of the jury in the inquest was:
 
Suicide.
We, the jury, find the:
1. Failure to remove the bedsheet and close the hatch allowing Jack to create a ligature point
2. Failure to refer to Liaison and Diversion services in Central and North-West London and the failure to open an ACCT whilst in prison custody, either of which would have triggered a more thorough risk assessment

He applied for indefinite leave to remain in 2004 but this was rejected in the same year.
2.        He had a history of severe mental health issues.
3.        Mr Santos was remanded to HMP Highdown on 29 October 2019, being transferred to HMP Belmarsh on 26 November 2019. On 6 May 2020, Mr Santos was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment and was due to be released on 27 October 2020.
4.        On 5 October 2020, the Immigration Service served an IS91 notice of a decision to detain on Mr Santos. This meant he would not be released from prison at the end of his sentence whilst his deportation was considered. A Stage 1 letter had been served on 28 December 2018 but a Stage 2 letter had not been served. There was also an outstanding appeal in the First-tier immigration Tribunal.
5.        Mr Santos wrote a letter on a bail form outlining his concerns about returning to Brazil, referring to his sexuality and his health. This was sent by the prison to a charity assisting immigration detainees on 29 October 2020.
6.        In the early hours of 2 November 2020, the night officer found Mr Santos hanging in his cell during a routine check. Staff tried to resuscitate him. Ambulance staff arrived. Mr Santos was declared dead at 3.30am.
 
In summary, the jury found as follows:
 
·       That Mr Santos’ understanding of his immigration position at the conclusion of his custodial sentence made a material contribution to his death.
·       There was a failure to notify Mr Santos of the incoming IS91 form and its significance.
·       The central issue was communication between Mr Santos and the various agencies involved with him. By 16 October 2020 Mr Santos understood he would be detained at the end of his sentence but was confident his bail application would lead to resolution. However in the days prior to his death he told a fellow prisoner he believed he was to be placed in immigration detention and deported within days.
·       Confusion amongst the agencies involved in communicating with Mr Santos is likely to have played a vital role in his change of understanding but it was difficult to pinpoint the role that information passed to Mr Santos played in changing his understanding of his position. There were no adequate notes of a meeting on 22 October 2020 with Mr Santos and his prison and community offender managers. However it was clear that his view of his circumstances changed and he decided to end his life and deliberately did not clearly communicate his intent to those around him.","During the Inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. A number of these have been addressed and do not require a PFD report.
 
I have also considered a report by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, “The experience of immigration detainees in prisons,” dated September 2022. Some of the key concerns in that report mirror concerns I came to independently having heard the evidence in this Inquest. Published responses to the report suggest some concerns are being addressed, albeit it is not clear if they have been resolved.
 
In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
1.      Although the specific issues below were not left to the jury as “causative matters” in this Inquest, I am concerned about the potential impact of these issues in other cases.
Timing of IS91 notification.
 
2.      The timing of the notification to Mr Santos by the SSHD that he was not to be released at the end of his custodial sentence but was to be held on immigration detention pending a decision on deportation. The SSHD target for notification is 30 days prior to release. In this case it was 8 days late. I heard PFD evidence that this 30-day target is not met in 40% of cases and that 83% of cases are notified within 7 days of the end of the sentence. I am concerned at the potential uncertainty and distress caused to Foreign National Offenders (“FNOs”) by notification at this stage.
Signposting legal advice about immigration matters
 
3.      Mr Santos signed a form on 24 October 2020 to receive support from a charity supporting immigration detainees. Bail forms were sent to them by the prison on 29 October 2020.
4.      I am concerned as to how access to legal advice is facilitated and signposted.
5.      In PFD evidence, I was informed that FNOs (in a similar position to Mr Santos) are now entitled to 30 minutes of free legal advice following a High Court decision in February 2021. In HMP Belmarsh, this entitlement is displayed on a notice in each Houseblock. I am concerned that displaying a notice is insufficient to draw this entitlement to the attention of FNOs. I do not know if this is a wider issue in other prisons. Understanding of immigration status, including appeal and bail procedures and is complex. Access to legal advice is vital to prevent confusion.
Communication between agencies
 
6.      Communication issues between the agencies dealing with immigration and sentence planning may lead to confusion and uncertainty for FNOs.
7.      I appreciate that any legal advice to FNOs should be from a legal adviser. I am encouraged that the probation service (who employ community offender managers) is seeking to develop a cohort of probation officers specialising in FNOs and immigration. There are now 201 SPOCs across 12 regions and a hub lead developing this model and leading engagement with the SSHD. There is no such model in the prison in respect of “prison offender managers” who also liaise with the SSHD about FNOs.
 
Delays by SSHD and Probation and failure to obtain information.
 
8.      I am concerned at the potential impact of delays/failure to obtain information in other cases. In Mr Santos’ case there were delays by probation in allocating a community offender manager and providing an up-to-date OASYS report. There were also delays by the SSHD progressing Mr Santos’ case, including issue of the Stage 2 letter, failure to obtain medical records and delay in requesting the OASYS report.
9.      I am encouraged that there is now a centralised system (and form) for the SSHD to request OASYS reports from probation although it is not clear the extent to which requests are going through this system. Consent to obtain medical information is sought from FNOs at an induction meeting by Immigration Prison Teams (“IPTs”). Further IPT officers attend prisons and play a key role in obtaining this type of information. However it is not clear what systems are in place to facilitate the obtaining of medical information.
The SSHD Internal report
 
10.    The SSHD disclosed an Internal report into Mr Santos’ case midway through the Inquest, which was not on his Home Office file. The lawyers representing the SSHD were unaware of this report. The head of FNO Returns Command only became aware of it the preceding week and understood it had been disclosed.
11.    The report detailed delays and issues in Mr Santos’ case and the SSHD then made formal admissions of the relevant (non-causative) failures which were recorded by the jury in the Record of Inquest at my direction.
12.    This report was dated February 2021 and listed action points for the relevant department. Although I am told that these are now being addressed, I am concerned that important learning points (which could prevent future deaths) were not disseminated and actioned as they should have been.","1.      The death of Manoel Messias Santos (“Mr Santos”) was reported to the coroner by HMP Belmarsh on the date of his death, 2 November 2020.                                                                                      .
2.      A forensic post-mortem was conducted on 5 November 2020. The medical cause of death of MS was 1a: Hanging
3.      On 24 February 2021 an Inquest was opened into the death of Mr Santos and an Article 2 Inquest was heard between 11 September 2023 and 25 September 2023 with a jury. The jury concluded with a narrative conclusion incorporating a conclusion of suicide.
4.      I considered Prevention of Future Death (“PFD”) evidence (written and oral) on 27 September 2023.","Action should be taken by The Secretary of State for the Home Department, HMP Belmarsh, His Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service, the Ministry of Justice and Practice Plus Group:
 
1.    Consideration as to whether FNOs can be notified at an earlier stage of their sentence that they are not going to be released. (SSHD)
2.      Consideration as to how to ensure there is effective signposting and facilitating of access to legal advice for FNOs. (HMP Belmarsh, HMPPS, MOJ)
3.      Consideration as to how to ensure more effective communication/information exchange between the SSHD and the prison and Healthcare. (HMP Belmarsh, HMPPS, MOJ, SSHD, Practice Plus)
4.      Consideration to be given as to why the Internal report dated February 2021 was not disseminated/placed on the Home Office file and to ensure this does not occur again. (SSHD)

3 | INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(On 15 July 2020 an investigation was commenced into the death of
Stewart Stanley. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest
held on 17 -27 July 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was Suicide in
addition the Jury answered a series of questions raised by me.

In summary, the Jury concluded that Mr Stanley's death was probably
caused or contributed to by a failure to follow the processes resulting in
the staff best qualified to appreciate Stewart's risk to himself being
excluded from the decision to remove him from constant watch. In the
addition the Jury concluded that the mult-disciplinary processes in place
were adequate however they were not fully complied with in this case.

@_| CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH
(On 23 June 2020 Mr Stanley was remanded in custody to HMP Exeter.

On the night of 9 to 10 July, Mr Stanley's cellmate found him
a seemingly tying to hang himself. He alerted
Dison staf, who started Prison Service suicide and self-harm prevention

procedures (known as ACCT). The staff placed Mr Stanley under
Constant supervision and moved him to a special cell that allowed an
officer to observe him continuously. On 11 July, after a case review it was,
decided that constant supervision should end and directed that Mr
Stanley should now be observed at least once every haif an hour during
the evening. At around 1.20am on 12 July, the night patrol officer, found

Mr Stanley hanging. She called for staff assistance and, when itarrived,
they opened the cell, removed the ligature and began chest
compressions. Paramedics arrived and took Mr Stanley to hospital, where
he died on 14 July.

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS:

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise
to concem. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur
unless action is taken. In the circumstances itis my statutory duty to
report to you

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

(1) The evidence revealed that there was an inconsistent approach
taken by staff when conducting and recording observations on
prisoners subject to the Prison Service suicide and self-harm
prevention procedures (known as ACCT).

(2) The evidence also revealed that some Officers had a different
interpretation of the requirements of set out in PS! 64/2011 in
respect of the timing of observations.

(3) The evidence also revealed that precise times of such
observations were not routinely being recorded accurately.

(4) During the evidence it became apparent that a prison officer
worked 23 hours out of 24, he was asked if this was normal and he
replied, “yes, to make the regime work.""

‘ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

(1) Consideration should be given to reviewing the process of
conducting and recording ACCT observations to ensure
accuracy and compliance with relevant policy and guidance.

(2) Consideration should be given to reviewing staffing levels,
retention, and recruitment to ensure the efficient and safe

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
HMP Aylesbury transitioned from a High Security Young Offenders Institution (a role it had undertaken for many years) into a Category C Training Prison after the time in which Haik Nikolyan had been an inmate. This has led to a quite different cohort of prisoners with different and additional issues to be addressed in their management and healthcare needs.
 
Staffing changes have also occurred over the period, although the physical prison infrastructure is largely the same with some wing refurbishments being undertaken from time to time.
 
Healthcare provision is also being undertaken by different providers today.
 
Following the conclusion in March this year of an Inquest into the death of another young prisoner, Anthony McNally, at Aylesbury (which occurred in January 2021), a letter was written by me to the Governor in which I noted, inter alia, that the evolution to Category C status required time and resources and was not without significant challenges going forward.
 
I was then (as now) interested to hear that appropriate resources continued to be sought and deployed by the prison to continue the work, from prison and healthcare perspectives, adapting to the Category C status, ensuring the safety and wellbeing of prisoners, staff and those with cause to visit the prison going forward.
 
Some three months further on, my concerns are heightened to the extent that a death may result in a variety of circumstances through the continuing significant issues HMP Aylesbury is encountering in recruitment and retention of experienced prison staff, particularly Grade 3 officers.
 
Although initial steps are being taken towards implementation of a new neurodiversity plan, including the management of prisoners with autistic traits (pertinent to the circumstances of the death of Haik Nikolyan in 2019) and some recruitment has just taken place, without appropriate resources specifically in this area and within the broader staff cohort, there will be difficulties in maintaining this important work.
 
The evidence heard at this Inquest in July 2023 indicates that general staffing levels are likely to impact upon the operation of the daily regime, training and reaction to individual incidents, against a background of increasing levels of violence and access to illicit substances, resulting from the changing cohort of longer-term and older prisoners within this Category C institution.
 
The indication in evidence was that addressing these issues and continuing to address these issues is a matter for His Majesty’s Prisons and Probation Service, working with HMP Aylesbury.",On 15 March 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Haik Patrick NIKOLYAN aged 21. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 12 July 2023.   ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 10th October 2023.

(0n 15 March 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Hak Patrick NIKOLYAN
‘aged 21. The investigation concluded at te and ofthe Inquest on 32 July 2023,

‘The jury recorded a narrative conclusion which stated
Halk was a vulnerable person with Autism Spectrum Disorder, who committed suicide
fallowing failures by those erganisations wha had cesponeiblty to protect hi from harm.
He had a documented history of mental heath difcutes, self-harm, depression, ane,
Suledal thoughts and sulige attempts. The decision to withdraw prescription medications
‘managing his depression without 2 documented risk assezement or enhanced monitoring
\Was net In his best interest and led to him experiencing psychological witnerawal
Symptoms, exacerbating his anxiety and depression. The insufficient securty atthe prison
Slowed legal crugs to circulate which contributed ta Mis Dullying and exploitation and
‘Created a barrier to accessing prescription medication

‘The prolife bullying, exploitation and humiliation that Halk experianced in prison
Contributes to his declining mental health. Policies, procedures and interventions put in
Place to safeguard him ware ineffective, ll-advised and at times absent. This resulted in
Ineffective communication, between the Prison, Health and Mental Health services which
meant information was recorded but inconsistently shared and acted upon effectively.
Furthermore, the absence ofa process for escalating concerns put him at heightened risk:

Due consideration for the complexities that Austem Spectrum Disorder can present were
not aporopriatly adcressea, Due toa lack of adequate training and the absence of 2
Clinical psychologist, some of his behaviours were interpreted to be dangerous rather than
the presentation of Autism Spectrum Disorder. This resulted in the Interventions that were
in place being ineffective, and incompatible with Halk’s needs and therefore this was an
unsuitable custodial environment for him.

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(On 23 February 2023, JDP Stevens, HM Assistant Coroner for Inner
North London, commenced an investigation into the death of Nicholas
Leger, aged 32 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the
inquest on 12 June 2023.

| made a determination of death by suicide.

‘The medical cause of death was:

41(a) Suspension by ligature

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Mr Leger had been the subject of a Metropolitan Police investigation
following a criminal allegation made in March 2022.

He was arrested and interviewed under caution at the end of May 2022,
following which he was bailed. That bail was converted to RUI (released
under investigation) in August 2022. He attended voluntarily a further
interview on § November 2022.

(On 23 January 2023, the CPS authorised that he be charged. This led
to the generation of a PCR (Postal Charge Requisition) which was
posted fo him on 16 February 2023. This did not arrive at Mr Leger’s
address until after his death. However, Mr Leger learnt of the charge via
his solicitor on the morning of 20 February 2023. Sometime between
7:30pm and 10:30pm on 20 February 2023, he took his own life.

He had previously attempted to take his own ile on 23 March 2022, after
he had leamt of the allegation made against him. The investigating
officer (OIC) was aware ofthis as Mr Leger had disclosed it when asked
questions regarding his mental health and welfare at the times of the two
interviews he attended. Although he had indicated at the times of the
interviews that he had no concems regarding his mental healthiweltare,
he also stated on 5 November 2022 that his mental health had suffered
since the alleged incident.

‘This was the last date that any assessment was made of his mental
health, By the time that he was sent the PCR (charging him with an
offence that carried a maximum life sentence), he had been “RUI'd’ for
almost 6 months and it was more than 3 months since there had last
been any formal assessment by the police of his mental health and risk
Of suicide or self-harm,

CORONER'S CONCERNS.

During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving
rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur
unless action is taken. In the circumstances, itis my statutory duty to
report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows,

| received evidence, in particular from the investigating officer (OIC), who
dealt with the investigation into the allegation against Mr Leger, and from
an investigator from the Metropolitan Police's Directorate of Professional
‘Standards (DPS), who conducted an investigation on behalf of the IOPC
into the way in which the criminal investigation was undertaken, in
particular the consideration of Mr Leger's welfare and support offered to
him,

| heard evidence:

‘That when a person who has been RUI'd is charged, standard
practice (in accordance with current Metropolitan Police policies
and procedures) is for that charge to be communicated to them
via a PCR with no advance warning.

‘That this is the case regardless of the offence, or seriousness of
the offence, with which they are being charged.

‘That in exceptional circumstances, where an. individual is,
considered to be in a high-risk category, arrangements can be
‘made for the PCR to be delivered in person and/or for a third party
to be present to provide support

‘That itis recognised that certain types of allegation, such as a
sexual allegation (as was the case here), may carry a higher risk.
‘This, of itself, does not place an individual into a high-risk category
for the purposes of delivering the news that they are to be charged,
(by way of a PCR),

‘That whether an individual is, exceptionally, considered to be in a
high-risk category (such as to cause a PCR to be delivered in
person) is reliant on information about their mental health coming
to the attention of the OIC. There is no formal requirement for the
OIC proactively to seek this information.

‘That there is no formal process for assessing an individual's,
mental health andlor risk of suicide or self-harm at the time of
delivery of a PCR.

Itis important to note the following:

‘At the point of charge, nothing has been proven against the
individual concerned. They face an allegation, and are innocent
if and until proven guilty to the criminal standard.

Many people are RUI'd. As such, PCR is now routinely used to
bring most criminal charges.

Individuals who have been RUI'd can remain with this status for
long periods of time (months or years) before a decision is made
whether or not to charge them.

Whilst there are formal procedures to assess an individual's
‘mental health and risk of self-harm or suicide when they attend a
police station for interview, once they have left the police station
there are no such formal procedures (as above), notwithstanding,

the potential for a substantial period to elapse between the time
they last attended a police station and the time that they are
charged.

‘+ Being charged with any criminal offence, especially one which
carries the potential for a custodial sentence, can, self-evidently,
have a significant deleterious effect on an individual's mental
health,

It appears to me that, in the absence of a formal mechanism to assess,
al the time of being charged, an individual's mental health and risk of
suicide or self-harm, there is an obvious risk of individuals in the future
taking their own lives as a result of being charged by way of a PCR
(potentially following a lengthy period of having been RUId and
potentially months or years since there was last any consideration by the
police of their mental health and risk of suicide or self-harm).

In Mr Legers case, the relevant policies and procedures were those of
the Metropolitan Police. However, these issues clearly arise at a wider
(national) level and, as head of the College of Policing, you have overall
responsibilty for policies/guidance disseminated at a national level

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and |
believe that you have the power to take such action,

YOUR RESPONSE

You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date
of this report, namely by 14 August 2023. I, the coroner, may extend the

Additional concerns were raised during triage and the matter was taken to a multi-disciplinary team. The team decided that Allison should be assessed face to face.

The assessment of Allison took place 9 months later. This was not a face-to-face assessment, as directed by the multi-disciplinary team. There was a telephone discussion, initially with Allison’s mother alone. Allison later spoke to the assessor but there was no full assessment of her mental state. There was no full exploration of the concerns raised in the referral and in the triage discussion. There was no evidence of the assessor determining the cause of Allison’s worrying presentation.
There was no carefully documented assessment of risk. There was no carefully devised risk management plan.

Allison continued to receive counselling provided at her school, but this concluded at the end of term, on the 15 July 2022. On the 18 July 2022 Allison was found suspended in her bedroom.

The Inquest heard evidence that the under resourcing of CAMHS services is not confined to this local Trust but is a matter of National concern.
 
The under resourcing of CAMHS services contributed to delays in Allison being assessed by the mental health team. The delay between triage to assessment was 9 months. The Inquest heard evidence that this delay is not unusual within CAMHS teams across the country.
 
There was very little evidence of any consultant psychiatrist leadership within the CAMHS team. The Inquest heard of the difficulties in recruiting suitably qualified psychiatrists to CAMHS teams.
 
The Inquest heard that funding for CAMHS teams within the allocation of funding for general mental health is poor.
 
The Inquest heard that the number of children presenting to CAMHS teams is increasing significantly. The number of referrals of children to the local CAMHS team in the early 2010s was between 10 – 12 per week.  The current number of referrals is in the region of 140 patients per week.

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

‘Took her own life by an overdose of prescribed medication at home and died in Hillingdon
Hospital on 12 August 2022

‘At the time she was in poor physical health and experiencing considerable anxiety as she
was trying, with assistance from the Council, to clear her home of numerous hoarded
possessions. She spoke with the single point of access (SPA)
crisis telephone service during the evening of 10th August to ask for help, but no mental
health assessment was performed and she was not called back by the team as promised.
Her neighbour requested a welfare check be performed the next day when she was found
collapsed and taken to hospital.

CORONER'S CONCERNS.

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my
‘opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the
circumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

Mrs Smith was recognised to be a hoarder and her council property was dangerously full of
items blocking all access, impeding stair access and impacting on her abil to access the
kitchen or bathroom. The gas supply had been cut off as she did not allow access for the
annual inspection.

Mrs Smith recognised she had a problem and asked the council for assistance. The offered
solution only moved some of her belongings into a local ""void"" property that she did not have
‘access to with no plan for how to resolve this temporary situation, creating considerable
‘anxiety and stress for Mrs Smith who then took her own life by overdosing with her
prescribed medication

(1) The inquest identified that there was insufficient staff training to deal with complex
hoarder cases.

(2) Other safety assessments such as a fire assessment andlor environmental health
assessment were not requested despite their being a clear need,

(3) The council “low chart"" was clearly not fit for purpose to assist staff in progressing
hoarder support and assistance and was focussed on enforcement procedures rather than
tenant support. The inquest was advised that the council's approach was not enforcement,
but their documentation did not support this.

(4) twas entirely unclear what options were available (if any) when the first plan of
assistance completely failed, leaving the vulnerable tenant excluded from her property with
ro forward plan,

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and | believe you Hillingdon
Council have the power to take such action,
YOUR RESPONSE

‘You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report,

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course ofthe investigation my inquiies revealed matters giving ise to concern In
‘my opinion there i risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the
circumatances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN ate as follows:
Preamble

‘The inquest heard evidence that Miss Zarins had suffered with depression since 2008. She
managed this by taking anti-depressant medication intermittently, she stopped taking her
anti-depressants in June/July 2021,

Miss Zarins came under the care of Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust (""LPT"") on 22
November 2021, after taking an intentional overdose the day before. Miss Zarins was initially
‘under the care of LPT's Mental Health Usison team but was transferred to the care of LP's
CRISIS Team when she returned to her home adéress on 22 November 2021. Miss Zarine
expressed a dese to work with the CRISIS team and to recommence anti-depressants as
soon as possible in order to improve her mental health

(On 23 November 2021 Miss Zarins was discussed at @ Multi-Discipinary Team (""MOT"")
‘meeting at LPT. The discussions at that meeting were fundamentally flawed, as was the plan
for Miss Zarins' care moving forward that was formed at that meeting and then
Implemented. The meeting proceeded on the basis that Miss Zarins was on, and had been on,
anti-depressant medication atthe time of taking the overdose, this was incorrect.

‘The second and final MOT meeting where Miss Zarins was discussed (on 24 November 2021)
also proceeded on this same mistaken bass.

Despite Miss Zarins verbalsing both her deste to get more sleep and her deste to go back
onto anti-depressants as soon as possible, nether sleeping tablets nor anti-depressants were
prescribed to her by LPT before she died. LPT continued to advise Miss Zarins that she would
have to wait until 30 November 2021 to have a medical review.

‘A member of LPT staff who was present at both MOT meetings informed the inquest that he
did not have time to read the notes of the patients that were to be discussed at the MOT
‘meetings. The staff member had not read Miss Zarins' core assessment documentation
{which correctly stated she was not on any anti-depressants) before either MOT meeting,

Evidence heard at inquest was that Miss Zarins should have been put back onto ant
depressants and prescribed sleeping tablets on 23 November 2021

LPT undertook a Serious incident Investigation into the care provided to Miss Zarins before
hher death. The investigation was wholly inadequate. Issues include, but are not limited to

41. There was no medical input into the investigation

2. The investigation failed to explore appropriately the functionality of the MOT
meetings

Decent Tenis Up SBS
‘3. The investigation failed to identify the error in understanding of the Miss Zaring)
‘medication position;

4. Due to the fact that the investigation failed to identity the error relating to the
understanding of the medication postion, the investigation also failed to identity the
fact that the treatment plan that was implemented was flawed. The investigation
failed to identify the fact that Miss Zarins should have been recommenced on ant
depressants and prescribed sleeping tablets before her death

Notwithstanding the inadequacy ofthe Serious incident report the document accepts that,
whist the anti-depressants would not have had an immediate impact on Mise Zarine’ mood,
the thought of having to wat a week for this medication may have added to her sense of.
hopelessness, This was echoed by witnesses at the inquest. | azo accept, on the balance of
probablities, and when considered alongside Miss Zarins' clear desire to recommence her
anti-depressants in order to get better, thatthe fat she was told she had to wait @ week for
‘3 medical review would have added to her sense of hopelessness.

Concerns

41) am concerned about the CRISIS team MDT meetings and ther functionality tis
difficult to understand how a meeting attended by around 7 people agreed a
treatment plan which was based upon incorrect information relating to the patient's
‘medication status. Ths is particularly efficult to understand when the correct
‘medication status is clearly documented in the patient's core assessment paperwork
{which was completed by the Liaison Team on 22 November 2021 and sent tothe
CRISIS Tear).

[An LPT staff member was candid about the fact that he didnot have enaugh time to
‘review patients’ records before the MOT meetings, ths isa grave concern.

2) remain concerned about both the standard of documentation and lack of
documentation relating to the discussion of Miss Zarns atthe two MDT meetings.
‘The Trust were only able to provide me with documentation relating to one of the
two MDT meetings. That documentation i incorrectly completed and lacks detail. In
particular, there is no detail about medication despite there being @spectic box
‘within which to document this,

This problem of poor and/or missing documentation isnot arsk that islimited tothe
CRISIS Team, its one that could have ramifications nat only across the Trust but
across all ofthe bodies who come together to provide cae for patents.

3) remain gravely concerned about the inadequacies in the Serious Incident
Investigation and Reporting processes at Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust.

‘The Serious Incident Investigation failed to identify the errors in the care provided to
Miss Zarns making the use of the process somewhat otosein this case. The fallure to
properly investigate led to the wholly untenable situation where errors in care were
Uncovered forthe first time at inquest, which took place some 20 months after the
date of death (due to witness availabilty).

lam concerned that the lack of robust eitical analysis and investigation ofthe care

‘provided to Mss Zarins before her death has caused a delay to, and ed to missed

with the exception of Bracford Counc, was able to provide the Court with an
‘verview/analyats of thele nvalvement with Lesh porto her desth and (where

‘The Police and the local Mental Heath Trust were examples of two public bodies who had

‘th Leah and confirm whether there ware any lessons to be learned by them.

‘The evidence provided by witnesses from the various Bradford Council teams which were
Involved with Leah, showed a clear cscannect in the involvement ofthe varous Council

‘Statements to the Court or the two who attended to provide aral evigence,

Whilst the Inquest hearing did not identify actons/omissions on the pat of

The desperation engendered by her delusional and medically entirely unfounded beliefs led to a number of suicide attempts and both voluntary and compulsory admissions to mental health units.   On the pt May 2021 Jo had attempted suicide [REDACTED] , some five weeks later, she would end her life. In the light of this incident her community risk assessment, her care plan and her safety plan were not up-dated – as they had not been since the date of her last discharge as a mental health in-patient on the 18th December 2020.
 
Whilst her high risk of suicide was acknowledged by the community mental health team responsible for her safety – and care, management and treatment – in the community, and notwithstanding the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, I found an inappropriate over-reliance upon her family members, principally her husband and son, to keep Jo safe in the community. This involved the family monitoring Jo 24 hours a day, seven days a week over an extended period and physically preventing her from leaving her home address unaccompanied .
 
This over-reliance was misguided and placed an unfair and unsustainable burden on the family, particularly in the light of a highly concerning text message sent by Jo to her Care Coordinator threatening suicide on the 11th June, the day before she took her own life. Following receipt of the text and seemingly reassured in part by Jo’s apparent retraction of the threat later that day, there was a failure to undertake an urgent face to face assessment by the community team to establish whether a referral to the Crisis Team was necessary; this specific failure possibly contributed to the subsequent death.
 
In the circumstances I concluded that an inappropriate over-reliance upon family members to keep such a vulnerable and high-risk person safe in the community, over an extended period of time, probably contributed to Jo taking her own life on the 12th June 2021.","During the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. Although not identified as causative of the death in this case, in my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –
1.     Evidence confirmed a conspicuous lack of clarity as to when, where and by (or between) whom any formal handover of responsibility as Care Coordinator (CC) for Jo took place as between a number of CCs allocated to Jo over a period of many months from the lead up to and following her discharge as an in-patient back to the community team on December 18th 2020 and through to early May 2021.
 
2.     Consequently , the evidence confirmed, despite her clear vulnerabilities, Jo did not have an allocated Care Coordinator for several weeks up to the beginning of May 2021. The evidence also confirmed that the lack of clarity as to the timing and conduct of CC handovers and the absence of an allocated CC to work with Jo (and by extension, her family) was informed by lack of a formal policy or procedure requiring that a full, detailed, formal record of handover between Care Coordinators is to be placed on EPUT electronic records.
 
3.    Evidence confirmed a conspicuous lack of clarity as to who, amongst EPUT clinicians/staff, has the responsibilitv for oversight of patient carefollowing discharge, including responsibility for ensuring adequate and appropriate safety-netting is in place in the event of relapse, where a Care Coordinator is no longer in place/has not been replaced.
 
Please note that this 3rd concern was previously raised by me with

FLEMING. The investigation concluded at the end ofthe inquest on 4 July 2023.

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Peter had a long history of depression, anxiety, and reported suicide attempts. He had
‘acknowledged his reluctance to always engage fully withthe treatment offered. On 308/22 he was
‘ferred to the home treatment team for casi Inorvention. After poor engagement he was
transferred back to the community mental health team. On 14/10 he was detained by police under
‘section 136 mental health act after expressing suicidal ideation. He told a psychiatric liaison
‘service nurse he had no ongoing suicidal ideation and was referred to the community mental
health team and his GP. He contacted the crisis taam on 30/10. He was telephoned by a mental
hhealth nurse on 31/10, and Peter reported upset about personal issues but no suicidal ideation. On

a deliberate overdose of his prescribed medication. At the time of his death he was on the waiting
list to be allocated a mental health care co-ordinator and there had been no mult-disciplinary
‘meeting with all teams involved to agree how best to work with Peter.

His cause of death was confirmed at post-mortem: 1a Carbamazepine toxicity.

‘The conclusion reached was death was a consequence of suicide.

(CORONER'S CONCERNS.

‘During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN aro as follows:

41. There continues to be a chronic lack of resources to treat seriously mentally ill patients in
Birmingham and Solihull. In the summer of 2022 Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health
Trust (‘BSMHFT)) wanted to admit the deceased to an inpatient psychiatric unit, however,
ro bed was available, and he remained in the community. Shortly before his death, the
deceased had been detained by the police under section 136 of the mental health act.
There was no available ‘place of safety’ and he had to be taken to an emergency
department. The police, BSMHFT, and hospital Drs agreed the deceased needed to be
assessed under the mental health act, however Birmingham City Council could not provide
‘an approved mental health practioner (‘AMPH’) to attend in a 24-hour period. When the
section 136 lapsed the deceased was discharged home after a review by a mental health
rurse, At the time of his death the deceased was on BSMHFT's waiting ist fora care-
coordinator. The lack of care-coordinators, mental health inpatient beds, ‘place of safety’
and AMHPS, presents a risk seriously mentally il people are not receiving necessary
treatment. The evidence is that thase issues are a consequence of a chronic lack of
resources at a local and national level. The Birmingham and Solihull coroners have been
repeating identical concerns in Prevention of Future Death Reports for many years,

2. BSMHFT utllzes sel-contained specialist teams. The deceased was treated by (a) crisis,
team/home treatment team, (b) community mental heath team, and (b) psychiatric liaison
team, The evidence demonstrated communication between the specialist eams was not
effective and this caused delays. For example, the psychiatric liaison team nurse that
reviewed the deceased updated the community mental health team. However, the GP
could not prescribe the deceased's medication in October 2022 because it had not been
approved by the community mental health team consultant via an ESCA and the deceased
went without his medication, The deceased's GP had to contact the community mental
health team directly notwithstanding the psychiatric liaison nurse's involvement. The
deceased cited this delay as making his mental health worse shortly before his death. My
concem is communication between the specialist teams is not effective enough. BSMHFT's
RCA action plan isto seek assurance from the CCGIICB that communication between the
specialist teams is being strengthened, My concern is that this does not go far enough and
there should be consideration of a formal process or policy.

3. Carbamazepine management was proposed in 2012 to manage the deceased's mental
health however this was not picked up by his GP and was only noted by a BSMHFT
‘consultant in August 2022. Therefore, the deceased went 10 years without this medication,
BSMHFT could not explain a the inquest why this omission had not been identified sooner.
BBSMHFT’s RCA action plan does not have any action to avoid a repeat occurrence. My
‘concam is tis issue indicates a problem with process and systems and further
Consideration is required to avoid a repeat occurrence.

44, The deceased's GP raised concems that different health organisations use different cigital
systems that do not communicate with each other. Further, GPs often do not get important
Patient updates from primary care organisations for many days or weeks. (See examples
above: the GP did not pick up the carbamazepine prescription, and could not prescribe the
‘medication in October 2022). My concern is communication between different health
organisations is not as effective as it could be and important information is being missed,
and consequently a material delay in treatment is occurring

5, The deceased's GP raised concems that current resources do nat allow GPs to pro-
actively check patients are collecting prescribed medication due to excessive patient lists.
‘My concern is that this is a consequence of lack of resources at a national level

in my opinion there isa risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the
{circumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
Preamble 
During the course of the inquest, evidence was heard about Mr. Ashton’s gambling activities, both prior to and, in greater detail, after July 2019. The evidence showed that Mr. Ashton had, at times, used a number of ways to protect himself from the potential of excessive losses from, and excessive deposits into, his online account, in order to gamble. Those methods included self-exclusion, temporary or permanent, from certain products and/or activities and placing limits on the value of his deposits and/or losses, during a specific, pre-determined period of time.
 
During the ‘relevant period’ examined closely during the investigation and inquest, between July 2019 and the date of Mr. Ashton’s death on 22 April 2021, although Mr. Ashton utilised a number of what are known as ‘player protection tools’, as outlined above, the operator he was gambling with during the relevant period, Betfair, did not take any measures, save for sending a number of e-mails to Mr. Ashton, to tell him about the existence of a number of protection tools that players could potentially access. During the relevant period, the evidence showed that Mr. Ashton was a problem gambler and, in the last 10-12 weeks of his life, his problem gambling became more acute, intrusive and, on balance, distressing to him.
 
Concerns
1)    I remain concerned that the player protection tools, as mentioned above, were and are inadequate to protect a person such as Mr. Ashton, who was a problem gambler with a worsening problem, specifically that such tools do not amount to any or any meaningful interaction with the gambler, or any intervention into the practices of the gambler.
 
2)     I remain concerned that the algorithm devised and operated by Betfair, to assist its staff in, amongst other things, observing and monitoring the gambling patterns and practices of its customers, failed to flag up Mr. Ashton as a problem gambler, despite the increases in his time online (gambling) the value of his deposits and the size of his losses, in part because his gambling practices, even in the last 10-12 weeks of his life, were deemed not to be exceptional, when averaged among gambling customers, generally.
 
3)     I remain concerned that, as was apparent through the evidence of a senior employee witness during the course of the inquest, the operator Betfair appears to judge the extent of its responsibilities to gambling customers solely with regard to industry (regulatory) standards, rather than current good or best practice in order to prevent further harming problem gamblers, or those who, as a result of their changing practices and patterns are likely to become problem gamblers.",On 06 May 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Luke Anthony Ashton aged 40.

Luke Ashton died as a result of his own actions, intending those ations to cause his death. At the time
cof his death, Luke was suffering from a gambling disorder, which was longstanding, at least from 2019
land which contributed to his decision to take his own life, In the months prior to his death, the
cevdence showed that Luke had been assessed as a low-risk gambler by the operator with whom he was
gambling, although Luke's gambling activity, deposits made and losses suffered were most intensive in
the 10 weeks prior to his death. The same operator did not intervene or interact with Luke, in any
‘meaningful way, between 2019 and the date of Luke's death, when more efforts to intervene or
Interact should have been made. Opportunities were missed which may possibly have changed the
‘outcome for Luke.

‘elt fsues, and ongoing symptomatology. He was placed on alist for aca
ceortnator in July 2021, but had not been allocated one prior‘ his death, due fo a
‘Shortage of and waiting ist for care-coardinator provision

In the past he had been admitad on several occasions, some under section, and had a
Fistory of overdose, and throwing himself in front ofa bus and talked of possibly jumping
off a building in around July 2021. His psychiatrist noted that his conditions would put
im at risk of impulsive behaviour, including sel-harm,

In around October of 2021, his prescriptions for his mood stabilser and antipsychotic
ore stopped, due his non engagement wih his GP, for about thee weeks

“These were restarted, but he experienced ste effects as they were recommenced,

“This was not appreciated by te clinicians caring for him.

{and behaviour mood fang and becoming anergie and allempte to suppor him and
‘accompany him fo appointments and assist with socal issues.

(On the 6” December 2021 he was seen for assessment by his psychiatrist through
MINT. He presented as capacitous, with some insight, complex, and intelligent He was
able fo give a good account af his past experiences and issues, His clagnoses were
Considered, and futher assessment was required. Follow up appoiniments wore offered
but arly he had die betore these occurred

(On the 17 December 2021 he attended Eats Court Station witha plan to jumpin front
ofa train, but asked fr help of staff. He was taken by police to Chelsea and
‘Westminster Hospital where he was assessed by laton peychiaty and requested
‘admission, He gave a history of inusive suicidal houghts,sleeplesenees due to fesues
witha neighbour and tobe at sk of suicide, leeplessness was a relapse indicator for
him, and his socal solation was recognised. Admission was recommended by
psychiatric aison,

ie was refered tothe CATT who found him nolo be auicdaland decharged him with
2 tablet of ciazepam and for follow up with MINT wihout discussion witha consultant
‘or psychiatric aison

hist the records taken by psychatic liaison were fll and descriptive and gave a
thorough impression of appearance and behaviour. presentation and assesemant of hie
presenting complaints, the assessment by CATT was ganericin style. Evidence taken
lve rom CATT was that Mr Khala was underplaying his suicidality to CATT, but
neverelass he was decharged.

‘The court heard that more than half of paionts assessed by CATT for informal
‘admission are discharged for community fellow up. and that one of the roles of CATT is
‘speciicaly to explore alternatives to admission. Patients discharged without admission
by CATT are not discussed with the on-call psychiatrists, whist patents fo be admitted

‘There is an on-call consultant psychiatrist at all times for palints tobe discussed,
‘Altempts were made to follow up Me Kala by MINT but these were unsuccessful

(On 28"" December 2021, Mr Khala re-prosented al Chelsea and Westminster with
Suicidalty and reassessed by a diferent psychiatric iaison nurse. Again, a thorough
‘assessment was undertaken. He was found tobe suieida, avoiding aye contact.
Intermitently cover his face with his face mask when distressed, to have stpi only
‘ne night since he was last seen, and to have been wandering the siaets at right rather
than go home, and he requested and requird admission to Keep him safe due to his
‘suicidality, to reviw is medication and care needs.

He was again seen by CATT. The notes recorded were again genetic, and ck box in
style Inve evidence it was accepted thal he aid have on going suicidal thoughts but no
plans nor intent. His complexity appeared underappreciated and many questions put to
{he CATT wiinses based upon the ascesement by peyehatclazon centring on his
‘demeanour and sleeplessness, which had taken place just a few hours previously, were
‘ot answered clearly by the CATT witness. The witness claimed that adission had
‘been discussed with Me Khala but decined and follow up by MINT agreed wth him,
despite its previous failure. The discussion which the CATT witness stated to have
taken place about admission was not recorded inthe notes,

‘The court had some questions of credibility of evidence of the CATT witness
who saw Mr Khala on 28 December 2021

Me Khala was discharged with two tablets of zopiclone for MINT follow up.
‘This occurred despite two admissions being requested ina short time, the
differing views of psychiatric liaison on both the attendances, the recent failure
‘of the same plan, his risks including social isolation, age, sex, impulsivity,
complexity and on-going suicidal ideation, his demeanour and the recurrence of
his relapse indicator of sleeplessness. His case was also not discussed with the
‘on-call psychiatrist.

‘The psychiatrist rom MINT stated that such cases should and could have been
discussed withthe on-call psychiatrist, especially given the difering views of psychiatric
liaison and CATT. and his complexity, risk and vulnerability.

‘The view ofthe psychiatrist was that Mr Khala shoul have beon admitted and would
have benefited from admission wih the opportunites that admission would have
afforded to Mr Khala to keep him safe and review his realment and care pan

“This was especialy 20 on the 28” December 202% after the previous plan had falad and
yetiwas tied again,

‘The evidence was that all cases whether discharged or admitted shouldbe discussed
withthe on-all psychiatrist. that there was remains, a shortage of care-coordinatos and
NMrkhala should have had ona, and that MINT has no access fo epeciaist advice or
‘assessment for ASD or ADHO within MINT which f this was available would also have
‘been of potantal benef to patonts such as Me Khala,

Matters of Concern

1. The genetic, tck-box style of history recording by CATT which does not paint a
{ull and proper pictur ofthe mental health ofthe patent especialy compared to
the assessments of peychiaris late, are such that risk may be unrecorded
‘and under appreciated by CATT and patients thus be put at risk

2. That the rle of CATT to look fr alternatives to admission may risk CATT
clscharging patients who would benefit from admission and rek he repeat of
‘making treatment plans that had recent failed such as in this case. Rathor than
looking for admission alematves being a core function, should CATT rather
better be focussed onthe best treatment plan forthe individual patient and thus
‘mission being viewed as a clear option where appropriate rather a last resort
2s often appears to be presented in such cases before the coroner?

43. Thal the provision of care-coordinatos be increased and improved eo that
patients who require them have ready access atthe time of naed and are not
placed on awaiting ist.

4. That pation tobe discharged by CATT, as well as patients tobe admitod are
clscussed withthe on-call psychatrit so that plans may be reviewed, and thus
the Fisk of not admiting pationts who would benef rom and! or require
‘admission such as Mr Kala, are less likely tobe discharged inappropriately

‘5. Thal where psychiatric teams difler in ther assossmonts such as CATT and
psychiatric laison, as occurred here, patents are nat discharged until opinion is
91 from the on-call consultant an re-discussion taken place between those
with aitfering vows

6. Thal expertise covering neurodevelopmental disorders such as ASD and ADHD
‘i avaiable as part of MINT.

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to
concem. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action
is taken. Inthe circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ~

1. The inquest heard evidence thatthe backlogs for therapy were such that
the waiting stat the time she was assessed as being appropriate for
step 4 therapy had a two year wait time. Since that time the walting
period had not decreased and was now between 2 -3 years in both
primary and secondary care. This was due to a shortage of trained
therapists and demands on the service and was a national issue not
spectfic to the CWP trust,

2. The inquest was told that the trust had since Michelle's death recognised
thatthe lack of ownership created through the application of ts referral
and discharge policy internally carried an unacceptable risk. Significant
changes had been made. Howaver twas unclear if nationally the lesson
had been shared and that other mental health trusts had taken similar
steps.

3. The evidence before the inquest was that there needed to be a clear
Understanding by all prosecuting authorities of the impact of a
prosecution on someone with a complex mental health background such
‘8 Michelle. In Michelle's case the BTP file raviewer (the nature of the
offence Michelle faced meant that it was not a CPS lawyer who made the
charging decision) had not correctly applied the public interest test and
had not considered the mental healthivulnerabilly of Michelle Jennings
as required to. As a consequence a decision was taken to prosecute her
Without an assessment of the impact on Michelle and her case was dealt

with By the Magistrates Court without them being given the full
background in relation to her deteriorating mental health. BTP are as a
consequence of Michelle's death taking stops to address how their
prosecution teams should deal with the public interest test and gather
Information where mental health is an issue, However there is no clear
‘mechanism for such learning and changes (to reduce the risk to if) in
relation to vulnerable people such as Michelle to be implemented within
the other 42 Police Forces in England and Wales or within other
‘agencies responsible for prosecuting criminal offences.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Patients who attend a Hospital Accident and Emergency Department with mental health difficulties are in most hospitals seen by a Mental Health Liaison team (made up of Consultant Psychiatrists and Mental Health nurses) These staff are not employed by the Acute Hospital Trust but are employed by a local Mental Health Trust (in this particular case it was the Sussex Partnership Foundation Trust).
 
As a result of their employment status the Mental Health Liaison team (who have the best knowledge of the patient having been caring for them) cannot invoke the Doctors or Nurses holding powers under Section 5(2) Mental Health Act (Section 5(4) for nurses). If a patient decides to abscond from the Acute Trust Hospital the Mental Health staff cannot detain/hold the patient. They would have to ask a Doctor within the Acute Hospital to do so. This Doctor may not have any knowledge of the patient and would be unlikely to act immediately in a busy A&E. By that time the patient would have been long gone.
 
Due to this technical issue around the employment status of the Mental Health Team, those suffering with a deteriorating mental health in an acute setting are at risk in these circumstances.","On 30th July 2020 Ms Hamilton-Deeley, the former Senior Coroner, commenced an investigation into the death of Rachel Kathleen Garrett aged 22 years. The investigation was concluded at the end of the Inquest on 2nd June 2023.

3 | INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

‘On 30"" July 2020 Ms Hamilton-Deeley, the former Senior Coroner, commenced
‘an investigation into the death of Rachel Kathleen Garrett aged 22 years. The
investigation was concluded at the end of the Inquest on 2°! June 2023. The
conclusion given was a narrative conclusion namely:

Rachel, who was suffering from a complex mental health disorder, took her own
life having suffered a deterioration of her mental health in the preceding months.
Despite the extensive support of her family and the care being provided by the
Mental Health services they had been unable to keep her safe. There was a
missed opportunity to prevent her from leaving the Royal Sussex County
Hospital on the second occasion on the 29 July 2020,

@ | CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH
Rachel had been struggling with her mental health for some time, but there had
been a marked deterioration in July 2020.

‘She had, on a number of occasions, been found close to the cliff edge in and
‘around Brighton. On each occasion she was either detained by the Police under
Section 136 Mental Health Act 1983 or voluntarily agreed to attend ARE at the
Royal County Sussex Hospital

‘On 28"" July 2020 Rachel had again been found on the clif edge. She was
detained under Section 136 Mental Health Act and was again taken to A&E in
Brighton. Before a mental health assessment could be carried out, she
‘absconded from the hospital and returned home.

Docunare Tempe Updsied STIZ021
Th the early hours of the 29° July her parents contacted the ambulance service
‘as they felt unable to keep Rachel safe. She was returned to A&E where she
was later seen by the Mental Health Liaison team. Throughout her time in ABE
she was nursed by an HCA on a 1 to 1 basis.

Although Rachel was found not to be delainable under the Mental Health Act the
Consultant Psychiatrist, who was part of the Mental Health Liaison Team, had
recommended that if she decided to leave the Hospital again, that consideration
should be given to the use of the Doctor's holding power under Section 5(2)
Mental Health Act.

Sadly, Rachel did leave the hospital for a second time and went back to the cliffs,
where she ended her life by falling from the clif top.

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS:

During the investigation, my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In
my opinion there isa risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.
In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:-

Patients who attend a Hospital Accident and Emergency Department with
mental health difficulties are in most hospitals seen by a Mental Health Liaison
team (made up of Consultant Psychiatrists and Mental Health nurses) These
staff are not employed by the Acute Hospital Trust but are employed by a local
Mental Health Trust (inthis particular case it was the Sussex Partnership
Foundation Trust).

‘As a result oftheir employment status the Mental Heath Liaison team (who
have the best knowiedge of the patient having been caring for them) cannot
invoke the Doctors or Nurses holding powers under Section 5(2) Mental Health
‘Act (Section 5(4) for nurses). Ifa patient decides to abscond from the Acute
Trust Hospital the Mental Health staff cannot detainhold the patient. They
would have to ask a Doctor within the Acute Hospital to do so. This Doctor may
not have any knowledge of the patient and would be unlikely to act immediately
ina busy A&E. By thal time the patient would have been long gone.

Due to this technical issue around the employment status of the Mental Health
‘Team, those suffering with a deteriorating mental health in an acute setting are
at risk in these circumstances.

‘ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN
In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and | believe you
(andlor your organisation) have the power to take such action.

‘YOUR RESPONSE

3 | CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS
I make this report under paragraph 7(1) of Schedule 5 to The Coroners
and Justice Act 2009,

INQUEST
An inquest into the death of Mr Wright was opened on 5 July 2022. The
inquest resumed on 22 May 2023 and concluded on 6 June 2023.

The medical cause of Mr Wright's death was:
1a, Quetiapine Toxicity
The inquest concluded with a narrative conclusion as follows:

‘On the night of 14 June 2022 or the early hours of the morning on 15 June
2022 Mr Wright took a deliberate overdose of his prescribed quetiapine
‘medication at his home address. At the time he took the overdose he
intended to take his own life. After he had taken the overdose he spoke to
a friend on the phone and allowed her to call an ambulance for him. He
also propped the front door open so that the ambulance would be able to
gain access on their arrival. However, on the arrival of the ambulance
crew Mr Wright was found to be deceased. His death was due to
quetiapine toxicity.”

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

In the early hours of the morning on 15 June 2022 Mr Wright's friend
(MERE S21 him a text message and Mr Wright called gg and told
[that he had taken ggg quetiapine tablets and he wanted to die.
[MN 222.2g¢< {0 persuade him to let call an ambulance.

ALO4:38 NM cang, 999 and informed the operator that Mr Wright
‘was conscious and breathing but that he had taken an overdose. [i
provided the details of what he had taken. [gM then called Me
Wright back and remained on the phone to him whilst they waited for the
ambulance. At 05:26 NM rang, 999 again and reported that she
thought that Mr Wright was now unconscious and she did not know ifhe
‘was breathing or not.

At06:40 an ambulance arrived at Mr Wright's address and he was
pronounced deceased at 07:39.

The court found that there was a delay from 05:10 onwards in carrying,
out an urgent clinical review of the first 999 call by staffat the Emergency
Control Room at South East Coast Ambulance Service (SECAMB). Had a
clinical review taken place at 05:10, the call would have been upgraded to

‘a Category 2 call with a target response time of 18 minutes from the
original call. In fact, the call was not upgraded to a Category 2 call until
| MM <alled back at 05:26, and thereafter an ambulance did not

arrive at Mr Wright's address until 06:40, one hour and 14 minutes later.

Whilst the above delays are clearly a matter of concern, the court was not
persuaded that they materially contributed to Me Wright's death,

The initial delay at 05:10 was due to individual error and therefore does
not form part of the concerns which you are asked to address in response
to this report.

However, the subsequent delay, which occurred following the second 999
call at 05:26, was because SECAMBS was in Stage 4 of its Surge
‘Management Plan, meaning that demand for the service was significantly
outstripping available resources and the service was not capable of
responding to calls within target timeframes.

During the inquest the court heard evidence from NNN Clinical
Manager at SECAMBS Emergency Control Room. jl gave evidence that
during the last reported quarter, namely January to April 2023, SECAMBS
had been operating at Stage 4 of its Surge Management Plan for 11.71 per
cent of the time. In the previous quarter of September to December 2022,
the Trust had been operating at Stage 4 for 45.73 per cent of the time.

| informed the court that there were various reasons for
SECAMBS being in Stage 4 of the Surge Management Plan on such a
frequent basis, including lengthy waiting times to hand patients over to
hospitals, insufficient staff numbers despite efforts to recruit both here
and abroad, as well as high numbers of staff sickness.

Whilst the reported figures indicate a notable reduction in the amount of
time SECAMBS is spending in Stage 4 of the Surge Management Plan as
compared with the latter half of 2022, it remains a matter of significant
concern that the Trust is unable to respond to calls within target
timeframes for 11.71 per cent of the time.

CORONER'S CONCERNS

‘The MATTER OF CONCERN is:

‘There is a tisk of a future reoccurrence of the situation which arose on 14
June 2022 given that SECAMBS is regularly operating at Stage 4 ofits
Surge Management Plan, meaning that demand for the service is
significantly outstripping available resources and the service is not
capable of responding to calls within target timeframes.

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN
In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I
believe that the people listed in paragraph one above have the power to
take such action.

YOUR RESPONSE
You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of its date; 1
‘may extend that period on request.

‘Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be
taken, setting out the timetable for such action. Otherwise you must

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
The concerns arising out of this investigation and inquest relate to the following key areas,
a)  Safeguarding
b)  Mental health provision
c)  Inter-agency communication – particularly where there is some doubt over who should provide additional support needed by a person.
 
We heard in evidence that in the months after Lucy’s death, a Safeguarding Adults Board considered the case, but did not consider that a Safeguarding Adults Review (‘SAR’) should be undertaken. Evidence from Wokingham Borough Council was that they were not at that time aware of the number of safeguarding referrals that had been made.
 
A decision was made (some six days before the inquest) that a SAR will now be conducted. The evidence of the Assistant Director of Adult Social Care was that this is likely to be completed within 1-3 months after the inquest.
 
I have set out the issues / concerns that I have for each of the two recipients of this report, below.
 
Reading Borough Council
1)  Time scales for review and triage of safeguarding referrals.
2)  Requirements to speak to the individual about whom safeguarding concerns have been raised.
3)  Training around Section 42 and when a report meets the threshold for neglect or abuse. This training should also consider what options are available if a concern does not meet the threshold for a Section 42 enquiry.
4)  Systems for making other involved agencies aware of safeguarding referrals and concerns.
5)  In relation to each of the above points, whether RBC should reflect the above changes in formal (written) policy, as well as delivering training.
6)  Improving interaction amongst agencies involved, and consideration of the threshold for arranging joint meetings to discuss service users, whether they meet Section 42 thresholds or not. The evidence we heard is that this is now being actively encouraged. Should there be written guidance about this somewhat subjective issue ?
7)  Whether they consider that the resourcing of this service is adequate and safe.
8)  Systems for auditing, and what will happen if the auditing reveals ongoing issues.
 
Berkshire Health Care
1)  How do the changes/proposed changes to systems (including the ‘One Team’ approach) make a difference? Specifically:
a)  Is the trust able to say with any confidence that a patient like Lucy would not be discharged from the crisis team without additional support, as she was on 2nd February?
b)  Is the trust able to say with any confidence that a patient like Lucy would be offered some support, whether by the crisis team or otherwise, in the situation that arose on the 15th February?
 
2) Do they consider that resourcing of these services is adequate and safe?","I conducted an inquest into the death of Lucy Anne Walles, which concluded on 16th June 2023.

Chris had enjoyed a long period of relative stabilty with his mental health

‘and 6/2/23 respectively.

He was admitted as an informal patient and, prior to his transfer to Cove
ward, had a number of episodes of escorted leave.

(On 8/2/23, the inquest heard that Cove ward was understaffed with only
one of three rostered nurses due to attend. Accordingly, the ward
manager, SN, came to work early to assist her nursing
colleagues. While treating another patient with suspected sepsis, Chris

(Qn 25 May 2021 | commenced an investigation into the death of Freeda
Glausiusz, aged 32 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the
inquest yesterday.

| made a determination at inquest of death by suicide whilst suffering a
psychotic episode.

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Freeda Glausiusz jumped from her ggg home on 15 May 2021. Her
father had called the crisis line in desperation the day before. His call
was not treated with the seriousness it deserved. It is unclear whether
any alternative action by the crisis team would have changed the
outcome.

CORONER'S CONCERNS.

During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving
rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur
unless action is taken. In the circumstances, itis my statutory duty to
report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows,

1

‘The East London NHS Foundation Trust (ELFT) serious incident

In reaching my conclusion at inquest that the call was not treated

observations. NNN was not taken seriously, he was not
treated respectfully and he was not treated kindly. He was clearly
desperate about his daughter's mental health and, as we now

requested witness statements and a copy of any internal

This chronology does not demonstrate an eagerness to promote
a learning culture by ELFT. The failure to provide prompt and
candid co-operation with my office obstructs the coronial inquiry,
an inguiry that includes the function of leaming from deaths. And
it does not demonstrate respect for the family of the deceased,

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
Evidence was given by staff members of the East London Foundation NHS Trust that:
 
1. The deceased was allowed to leave Gardener Ward (“the unit”) which was part of a secure facility of the hospital, alone, when a clinical decision had been taken that they should not be allowed to leave the unit unaccompanied by staff, because they posed a serious risk of suicide.
 
2. The decision that the deceased should not be allowed unescorted leave was not communicated to all members of staff working in the unit such that the person who allowed the deceased to leave was unaware that the decision had been made.
 
3. The relevant information gathered during the Ward Round on the 28th October 2021, which included the fact that the deceased had attempted to take their own life, the night before, was not adequately communicated to all staff on the unit.
 
4. The “Sign in/Sign out” book which was supposed to record the movements of service users in the unit was frequently not completed, particularly when service users went out for short periods.
 
5. There was no proper system for identifying whether a service user should be permitted to leave the unit.
 
6. The member of staff who allowed the deceased to leave the unit made a brief risk assessment of them before deciding whether they should be allowed to leave. That person did not consult any medical notes or records about the deceased when making that assessment. Had that member of staff consulted the deceased’s medical notes and records, the serious suicide risk which they posed would have been evident.
 
7.  Once the deceased was found to be missing from the unit, there was an unexplained delay in informing the police and ambulance service, a failure to inform either of the serious suicide risk which the deceased posed to themselves and a lack of appreciation of the urgency of the situation by staff generally.
 
8. The hospital policy which applied to missing patients was not properly adhered to by staff and there was confusion about who should be contacted and in what manner, once a patient was found to be missing.
 
9. No proper efforts were made to contact members of the deceased’s family once the deceased was found to be missing.
 
10. The unit was short-staffed and this affected the care provided to the deceased, the assessment of the deceased whilst in the unit and record keeping generally.
 
The summary of the evidence given, as set out above, sets out the matters of concern.","On the 11th November 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Hilary Clare (Billy) Guedalla who died aged 46 on the 30th October 2021 [REDACTED].
 
The investigation resulted in an inquest, which was conducted by myself over a period of 5 days and concluded on 19th May 2023.
 
I made a determination at inquest that the deceased died as a result of suicide and returned a narrative conclusion as follows:
 
1. The deceased suffered from long standing psychiatric conditions of a Recurrent Depressive Disorder and complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
 
2. On occasions, the deceased’s psychiatric conditions led to psychiatric in-patient admission to hospital, usually as a voluntary patient, on a number of occasions between 2013 and 2021. Those admissions were associated with the deceased exhibiting suicidal ideation and sometimes involved attempts to take their own life.
 
3. On the 26th October 2021, the deceased was admitted to Gardener Ward, Homerton Hospital, London E9 as a voluntary patient suffering a worsening of their psychiatric condition.
 
4. At a ward round at that hospital on the 28th October 2021, at around 11am, the deceased indicated to staff that they had tried to take her own life the night before in hospital and that they had equipment at home for the purposes of ending their life.
 
5. The deceased’s condition worsened thereafter and staff at the hospital considered that the deceased should not be allowed out of the ward alone, for her own safety because, in effect they were a high risk of suicide. That decision was made in the morning of the 29th October 2021 but not communicated to all staff on the ward.
 
6. The deceased asked a member of the clinical staff to leave the ward, at around 6pm on the 29th October 2021. That member of staff was unaware of the decision that had been made that the deceased should not be allowed out alone. The member of staff carried out a brief assessment of the deceased, largely based on their appearance, but did not refer to any medical notes and records. The deceased was then allowed to leave the ward.
 
7. Sometime between leaving the ward and around 3pm on the 30th October 2021, the deceased took their own life by hanging themselves [REDACTED]. No-one else was involved. The deceased was found by members of the London Fire Brigade between 3 and 4pm, on that day.
 
8. After the deceased had left the ward, night staff found the deceased to be missing at around 8pm on the 29th October 2021. Staff first contacted the police 2.10am and again at 2.46am on the 30th October, 2021 and requested that the police carry out a welfare check. They did not inform the police that the deceased was a serious suicide risk. They were advised to contact the London Ambulance Service but did not do this until 3pm on the 30th October 2021 and in any event, that request did not generate attendance at the deceased’s home address.
 
9.  At around 2pm on the 30th October 2021, the deceased’s mother attended the ward having made a pre-arranged booking to visit the deceased. She was shocked to be informed that the deceased had left the ward. She enlisted support from family and friends which led to the attendance of emergency services at the deceased’s home address, between 3-4pm on the 30th October 2021.","In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that your organisation has the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by the 4th August 2023.

On the 11"" November 2021 | commenced an investigation into the death
of Hilary Clare (Billy) Guedalla who died aged 46 on the 30"" October

2

The investigation resulted in an inquest, which was conducted by myself
over a period of 5 days and concluded on 19 May 2023.

| made a determination at inquest that the deceased died as a result of
suicide and retuned a narrative conclusion as follows:

1. The deceased suffered from long standing psychiatric conditions of
a Recurrent Depressive Disorder and complex Post Traumatic Stress
Disorder.

2. On occasions, the deceased's psychiatric conditions _led_to

psychiatric in-patient admission to hospital, usually as a voluntary patient,
fon a number of occasions between 2013 and 2021. Those admissions
were associated with the deceased exhibiting suicidal ideation and
sometimes involved attempts to take their own life

3. On the 26th October 2021, the deceased was admitted to
Gardener Ward, Homerton Hospital, London E9 as a voluntary patient
suffering a worsening of their psychiatric condition

4. Ata ward round at that hospital on the 28h October 2021, at
around 11am, the deceased indicated to staff that they had tried to take
her own life the night before in hospital and that they had equipment at
home for the purposes of ending thelr life.

5. The deceased's condition worsened thereafter and staff at the
hospital considered that the deceased should not be allowed out of the
ward alone, for her own safety because, in effect they were a high risk of
suicide. That decision was made in the morning of the 29th October 2021
but not communicated to all staff on the ward,

6. The deceased asked a member of the clinical staff to leave the
ward, at around 6pm on the 29th October 2021. That member of staff was,
unaware of the decision that had been made that the deceased should
not be allowed out alone. The member of staff carried out a brief
assessment of the deceased, largely based on their appearance, but did
not refer to any medical notes and records. The deceased was then
allowed to leave the ward,

7. Sometime between leaving the ward and around 3pm on the 30th
October 2021, the deceased took their own life by hanging themselves jj

No-one else was
Involved. The deceased was found by members of the London Fire
Brigade between 3 and 4pm, on that day.

8 After the deceased had left the ward, night staff found the
deceased to be missing at around 8pm on the 29th October 2021. Staff
first contacted the police 2.10am and again at 2.46am on the 30th
October, 2021 and requested that the police carry out a welfare check
They did not inform the police that the deceased was a serious suicide
risk. They were advised to contact the London Ambulance Service but did
riot do this until 3pm on the 30th October 2021 and in any event, that
request did not generate attendance at the deceased's home address.

9. At around 2pm on the 30th October 2021, the deceased's mother
attended the ward having made a pre-arranged booking to visit the
deceased. She was shocked to be informed that the deceased had left
the ward. She enlisted support from family and friends which led to the
attendance of emergency services at the deceased's home address,
between 3-4pm on the 30th October 2021

70. The deceased should not have been permitted to leave the ward
alone. Had clinical staff observed the decision not to allow the deceased
out without a staff member, the deceased would not have taken their own
life when they di.

11, The decision that the deceased should not be permitted
unescorted leave failed to be communicated to all staff members on the
ward,

12, The information that the deceased had tried to end their own life
con the ward on the evening of the 27th October 2021 was also not
properly communicated to all staff on the ward or added to any document
Which concemed a proper risk of assessment of them. Also, the hospital
staff did not fully comply with the patient admission policy when the
deceased was admitted on the 26th October 2021 as records were not
properly updated and no physical health assessment was made of the
deceased within 24 hours.

18. The decision that the deceased was to receive 1:1 support
following the ward round of the 28th October 2021 could not realistically
be met because of staff shortages on the ward. There was a failure to
recognise that this plan would could not realistically be achieved because
of those staffing issues.

14, The assessment made of the deceased before the deceased was
allowed to leave the ward at 6pm on the 29th October 2021 by that
member of staff was inadequate as a risk assessment of the deceased's
‘mental state for the purposes of assessing their safety. That member of
staff relied solely on the deceased's presentation at that moment and did
not consider any written record about the deceased or ask any other
member of staff about how the deceased was.

18. There was a complete failure to appreciate the urgency of locating
the deceased once the night staff found them to be missing at about 8pm
fon the 29th October 2021 and to follow the hospital policy which applied
to missing patients.

16. Night shift staff took far too long to contact the emergency services
and falled to contact the ambulance service as advised by the police in
the early hours of the 30th October 2021

17. When the police were contacted, staff completely failed to state the
urgent and serious suicide risk which the deceased presented to
themselves.

18. Hospital staff also failed to properly contact Billy's family and
friends after they went missing from the ward or leave messages for them
which could have enabled them to be located.

19. Staffing levels on both the 29th and 30th October 2021 were not

‘adequate and this contributed to the failings set out above.

20. The failure set out above which relates to the staff member being
unaware that the deceased should not leave the ward unaccompanied,
amounts to a serious failure which directly caused or contributed to the
deceased's death.

21. The other failures set out above amount to missed opportunities
which may directly or indirectly, have prevented the deceased's death,

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

‘The circumstances surrounding the death are set out in Box 3 above.

CORONER'S CONCERNS.

During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving
rise to concer. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur
unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to
report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows,

Evidence was given by staff members of the East London Foundation
NHS Trust that:

1. The deceased was allowed to leave Gardener Ward (‘the unit
which was part of a secure facility of the hospital, alone, when 2
clinical decision had been taken that they should not be allowed to
leave the unit unaccompanied by staff, because they posed 2
serious risk of suicide.

2. The decision that the deceased should not be allowed unescorted
leave was not communicated to all members of staff working in the
unit such that the person who allowed the deceased to leave was
unaware that the decision had been made.

3. The relevant information gathered during the Ward Round on the
28"" October 2021, which included the fact that the deceased had
attempted to take their own life, the night before, was not
adequately communicated to all staff on the unit.

4, The “Sign in/Sign out"" book which was supposed to record the
movements of service users in the unit was frequently not
completed, particularly when service users went out for short
periods.

5. There was no proper system for identifying whether a service user

should be permitted to leave the unit.

6. The member of staff who allowed the deceased to leave the unit
made a brief risk assessment of them before deciding whether
they should be allowed to leave. That person did not consult any
medical notes or records about the deceased when making that
assessment. Had that member of staff consulted the deceased's
medical notes and records, the serious suicide risk which they
posed would have been evident.

7. Once the deceased was found to be missing from the unit, there
was an unexplained delay in informing the police and ambulance
service, a failure to inform either of the serious suicide tisk which
the deceased posed to themselves and a lack of appreciation of
the urgency of the situation by staff generally

8 The hospital policy which applied to missing patients was not
properly adhered to by staff and there was confusion about who
should be contacted and in what manner, once a patient was
found to be missing

9. No proper efforts were made to contact members of the
deceased's family once the deceased was found to be missing.

10.The unit was short-staffed and this affected the care provided to
the deceased, the assessment of the deceased whilst in the unit
and record keeping generally.

The summary of the evidence given, as set out above, sets out the
‘matters of concern.

paragraph 7, Schedule 5, and

‘The Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013,
regulations 28 and 29.

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(On 16 June 2020, one of my assistant coroners, Jonathan Stevens,
‘commenced an investigation into the death of Heather Findlay, aged 28
years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest earlier today.

‘At inquest, the jury came to a conclusion of death by suicide, making a
narrative determination that | now attach, and giving a medical cause of
death of:

11a hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy
‘1b sodium nitrate toxicity

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

‘At the time of her death, Heather Findlay was in the care of the East
London Foundation Trust (ELFT), detained under section 2 of the Mental
Health Act at Mile End Hospital.

‘At approximately 3pm on 11 June 2020, she was on s17 escorted leave,
standing with a healthcare assistant (HCA) at the front gates of the
hospital having a cigarette, when she turned to the HCA, said “I'm sorry
| have to do this to you"" and ran away.

ELFT contacted the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) at 3.17pm, but
by 3.58pm, Ms Findlay had been found by a member of the public in a
nearby park.

CORONER'S CONCERNS.

During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving
rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur
unless action is taken. In the circumstances, itis my statutory duty to
report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows,

1. When Ms Findlay ran off, the HCA escorting her was so panicked
that she did not even think of following. Ms Findlay had run across
a road and so chasing her at speed did present safety
considerations. However, the ELFT policy, training, culture and
expectation was such, that there the HCA did not at any point
‘consider attempting to walk after her to keep her in sight. Clinical
staff must be adequately prepared for such an eventuality.

‘That means more than simply a change in policy wording,

2. By the time the HCA rang the duty senior nurse for advice Ms
Findlay was out of sight, and so the HCA was instructed to return
to the ward.

| heard evidence that an email is to be sent out shortly to explain
that a new ELFT absent without leave policy will be in place by
the end of June 2023. The new policy will confirm that, ifitis safe
to do so an escort may follow a patient who has absconded,
keeping them in line of sight whilst ringing the duty senior nurse
for instructions.

However, there is no ELFT policy for what those instructions
should be or even what they could include. No member of ELFT
{gave evidence of any organisational thought having gone into how
then to progress such a situation, other than the ward calling the
police to report a missing person. No member of ELFT giving
evidence was able to set out what the staff member following
should do.

‘This appears to be a significant omission.

3. Moreover, one of the MPS policy leads in this area gave evidence
that in such a situation the police would not necessarily attend,
even if called direct by a hospital staff member in the street
following a patient about whom they are worried

| spent some time examining the police regarding this point, and |
was left with the impression that a clinician calling the police in
what the clinician perceived to be an emergency situation might
not be assisted by the police,

‘That concerned me.

4. I heard that Right Care, Right Person is an operational model
developed by Humberside Police that changes the way the
emergency services respond to calls involving concems about
‘mental health. | understand that its in the pracess of being rolled
ut across the UK as part of ongoing work between police forces,
health providers and government.

| heard that the MPS has already created a similar model under
the resource and demand team. The protocol is called Affinity. It
attempts to target preventable demand from the mental health
trusts,

| was told that ELFT and the MPS work in partnership, so | asked
the MPS what is meant to happen if an escorts following a patient
who has run away and about whom the escort is worried.

| was told that this is primarily 2 health problem. It was pointed
out that doctors, nurses and other hospital staff have the same
powers as the police under section 18 of the Mental Health Act.
Hospital employees have the legal authority to take a sectioned
patient into custody and return them to hospital.

However, | heard nothing of an ELFT protocol that would advise
staff on the ward to come out to assist an escort who already
following a patient. | heard nothing of a trust contingency plan that
would allow @ ward to function without the doctors and nurses
needed to undertake such a task. | heard nothing of any training
given to doctors and nurses in how to restrain a patient in the
middle of the street and to transport them back to the ward.

From the evidence | heard, the police / health trust partnership
working allows each agency to regard such a situation as the
other's responsibility, whilst nobody is on the ground attempting
to retrieve a seriously ill patient who is meant to be inside a locked
ward for their own safety.

Whether this is a matter of policy or practice, the result is the
same. If partner agency working is to be effective in caring for this
extremely vulnerable cohort of patients, there needs to be crystal
clear understanding by all those involved, from the highest policy
maker to the most junior member of a team at the sharp end, of
how to tackle these dificult situations and exactly who is meant to
be doing what.

Evidence was given that the police classify a person at high risk
as: the risk is immediate and there are substantial grounds for
believing immediate risk of self harm,

| was told by the MPS that, at the time of reporting to the MPS,
trusts should volunteer their own grading of the patient's risk. The
police said that they will not necessarily following the trust grading,
but they regard it as a significant factor and it should form part of
the MPS thinking. ELFT witnesses told me that if the police did
not ask for the trust's grading then the trust would not offer it.

| was told that, until Apri 2022 the grab pack prepared by ELFT
for the MPS in such a situation was printed out and handed to
police if & when the police attended the ward. Itis now filed out
on a portal as part ofthe reporting procedure. However, itis not
clear to me how far the grab pack aligns with local policies,
whether all useful information (including the trusts grading of risk)
is recorded as a matter of routine, and how far the police and the
trust are using the same terminology with the same definitions.

It'seems that this would benefit from consideration,

6. ELFT staff all told me that, after Ms Findlay had run off, they stil
graded her as medium rather than high risk. She had had long
term suicidal thoughts, had made previous attempts on her life
and, prior to being admitted to hospital on 20 May 2020 had
purchased sodium nitrate and had planned to take this to kill
herself. However, she had appeared to improve in hospital, and
had been granted 15 minutes’ escorted leave twice a day since 1
June without incident.

‘At one point in her evidence it appeared to me that the matron,
taking the point that by running away Ms Findlay had acted in a
‘manner that was wholly unexpected by the trust, was of the view
that Ms Findlay should then have been re-categorised as high
risk. However, following re-examination by counsel for ELFT the
matron appeared to retract this and to return to her former position
that, even after she had run away Ms Findlay was only of medium
risk to herself.

It is of course a matter of clinical opinion what risk grading a
patient should be given, and no person can see into the future.

However,

‘© the jury found a failure by ELFT to recognise that, by 11
June 2020, Ms Findlay was at imminent risk of suicide by
sodium nitrate; and

‘+ any investigation following a death like Heather Findlay's
presents an opportunity for sober and searching reflection,

So | am concerned that an element of positional bias may have
influenced the thinking of ELFT staff.

| am concemed about this particularly because, when giving
evidence at inquest, the ELFT serious incident investigation
author was adamant that it was only appropriate for the HCA who
called the police on 11 June 2020 after Ms Findlay had run away,
to tell the police of a risk of self harm not of a risk of suicide. Her
rationale for this was that the last time Ms Findlay had articulated
a plan to kill herself, was when she was found in hospital with a
ligature round her neck on 28 May 2020.

This position seems lacking the necessary reflection

| draw your attention to earlier prevention of future deaths reports (PFDs)
as follows:

‘+ Sent to ELFT on & June 2023 by Assistant Coroner Buckett
following the inquest touching the death of Hilary (Billy) Guedalla,
including concern regarding the failure of ELFT to inform the
police of the serious suicide risk that the deceased posed to
themselves; and the confusion among staff about who should be
contacted and in what manner, once a patient was found to be
missing

‘+ Sent to ELFT on 25 January 2023 by me following the inquest
touching the death of Andrew Largin, including concern about
‘omissions from a serious incident investigation.

‘+ Sent to ELFT on 20 October 2021 by me following the inquest
touching the death of Freeda Glausiusz, including concern about
a lack of learning culture at ELFT.

UI Alcohol dependence
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

The record of inquest ead a follows ""Brenda hil ed in her hor
Carisle on 8th December 2022. She took her life by ligature suspension whe under Me

influence of a very high blood alcohol level"". A narrative conclusion was given.
Brenda worked as a healthcare assistant in ARE at Cumberland Infirmary, she had for some
time been alcohol dependent with binge sessions which often caused domestic friction with her
husband, there was an incident of domestic violence requiring police involvement. Matters had
been worse since she developed cauda Equina Syndrome which required neurosurgical
intervention in 2021, and had ongoing low back pain which she tended to medicate with

alcohol. She had had episodes of anxiety in 2005 & 2007, depression on 2016 & suicidal
ideation in 2018. On 26/10/22 she was admitted to A&E in Carlisle (her own workplace) with an
intentional overdose. She was followed up and treated by her GP. On 10/11/21 there was a
serious incident when she was found by police on the riverbank, she had intended to enter the
‘water but was talked down from this by her GP. Brenda was admitted to hospital (Hadrian unit]
as a voluntary patient.

Brenda was not comfortable in the ward environment and on 14/11/21 discharged home to be
{followed up by the Crisis Team who did visit her at home the following day. Brenda's GP was
not informed of her admission or discharge so was unaware of events unt a prearranged
telephone call on the 15th. Brenda was followed up at home and by telephone, at several
contacts she was noted to be under the influence of alcohol. Brenda was discharged after a
final ""MDT"" meeting on 6/12/22 [it is not clear who was involved}, declining further input and
denying any thoughts of self harm, a risk assessment on 8/12/22 records low or no apparent
risks, this was the day Brenda died.

CORONER'S CONCERNS,

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concer. In my
opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances
itis my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —
[BRIEF SUMMARY OF MATTERS OF CONCERN]

(1) Brenda was discharged without any planned follow up. Her family were not involved in the
discharge process despite assurances that they would be, her GP did nat receive discharge
notification from the Hadrian unit until 8 days after the event or from the Crisis team until 10,
days after Brenda's death. Referrals promised from Hadrian unit to Drug/Alcohol services and
Persistent Physical Symptoms Service were not made,

(2) Inadequate weight seems to have been given to Brenda's alcohol problems and her
assurances that all was, and would continue to be well were accepted at face value despite
her recent history, her family find it hard to understand how she could be graded low risk on
the day she died

(3) | refer you to the PFD report | issued referring to Charlotte Grace on 29/10/19. Assurances
‘were given in response to that report which again focused on discharge without family/carer
involvement which is surely paramount. | note actions mentioned in the incident report in this,
case but am still concerned that similar events may occur in future.

wider trust have the power to take such action

He had a past medical history of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma having had the diagnosis on 12 January 2022 and poorer mental health as a result. Other than the lymphoma he had no other significant past medical history. The anticipation of awaiting scans and treatment impacted severely upon his mental health but he had significant family support. Eifion was regularly reviewed by a GP and medicated accordingly. He had previous attempts at self-harm by way of medication overdose or self-inflicted injury. He had been under the care of the Community Mental Health Team including Home Treatment Team and primary care since early 2022 up to his death. His acts of self-harm were impulsive but serious. On 10 June 2022 Eifion had left his home address to attend his daughter’s home across the road to let the cat out. There was a concern for Eifion when he did not reply to a text message from his wife around 15 mins later who then attended at their daughter’s home and on opening the front door found Eifion suspended by a ligature [REDACTED]. Eifion was confirmed as having passed away at the property on 10 June 2022 at 10.37 by an attending paramedic.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.
 
In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
1.      a. During the Inquest evidence was heard that Eifion’s GP had made a ‘very
urgent’ referral to the Single Point of Access and Allocation within BCUHB on 13 May 2022 indicating that on the background of attempts at ending his life, he was extremely concerned that Eifion was experiencing deterioration in his mental state. This document was contained within the hard copy set of notes held by the Psychiatric Liaison Team. When Eifion attended at the Emergency Department the following day, on 14 May 2022, the Emergency department staff were not aware of this ‘very urgent’ referral as they only had access to the electronic notes and not the hard copy notes. Had they been aware it is likely to have further informed their decision making. It is concerning that the process of ensuring electronic notes to allow for fully informed decisions around treatment and care based on all available records, is not available to staff. It was not clear at Inquest whether the transition from paper-based notes to electronic notes was a Health Board initiative or a nationally followed initiative. Either way, any delay in ensuring all notes are available electronically is potentially harmful to patients.
 
b. During the evidence it was accepted that ‘a’ above was not a consideration for improvement as part of the Health Board’s investigation and so was not an action within the Action Plan upon which it could make improvements or plan to make improvements. It is surprising that the Health Board did not consider this as an issue which required further consideration and improvements in its learning and improvement.
 
An investigation was commenced by the Health Board into Eifion’s death which appears to have been concluded in July 2022 but did not appear to be finalised and ready for sharing / disseminating until March 2023. I have previously issued Prevention of Future Death Reports to the Health Board pertaining to the lack of timeliness of their investigations, specifically in relation to investigations from deaths in 2020 and 2021. Whilst I have previously been advised of improvements into investigation processes in respect of more recent deaths the issue of timeliness remains. Eifion died in 2022 and yet the time it took for the investigation to be completed and shared, with actions undertaken has been too long. I am concerned that deaths will occur when the actions arising are not acted upon in a timely manner.","On 21 June 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Eifion Wyn Huws (DOB 25/4/59) who died on 10 June 2022.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ~

(1) On 4 July 2022 Me. Harpor attended the Emergency Department at Gloucester
Royal Hospital, and was seen by a nurse from the Mental Health Liaison team
there, who recorded that Ne was very anxious and distressed, and voicing
‘ongoing thoughts af suicide. The nue fel hat Me, Harper would benefit rom

pared of weatment under tha care ofthe Home Treatment Team, and because
fir Harper was ving in Worcestrshire a the timo, and because twas now in
‘he early hours ofthe fllowng day he called the Worcestershire Crisis Team to
“arrange that. The nurse concemed was under the Impression tat by making
{hs phone call, and passing on Mr. Harper's details othe Crisis Tear, he was
‘refering Mr. Harper's case to them. He tol the inquest! that he was expecting
‘mental heath series in Worcestershire to arrange a further urgent assessment
‘tM Harper, nd he therefore ensured that Me. Harper was tld to expect the
Crisis Tear to contact him to arrange a further assessment.

(2) The Cinical Lead forthe Crise Team in Worcestershire gave evidence tothe
‘Inquest hat whist he Crisis Team di receive a request ftom the nurse st
‘Gloucester that right, thoy iniorpreted it ony as a request or further
‘assessment (but not an urgent one ) and not asa request that Mr. Harper be
fefered tothe Home Treatment Team.

(@) Inthe event an urgent assasement was not arranged, and Mr. Harper's case
was only considered bythe Home Treatment Team in Worcestershire when his
temporary GP in Worcestarshire, out of further concer for Mr Harper's mental
health, made a new and separate reeral to them.

(4) Ihave concided thatthe events described above arose out ofa lack of
Understanding batwean the two NHS Trusts concerned (Hereford &
Wireestorshire Health and Care NHS Trust HWWHCT ) and Gloucestersire
oath and Care NHS Trust (GHCT ) ) as te how each ohrs mental health
Services are run - otherwise arrangements would have been made for Mr.

James Colson, aged 34 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on
the 18 May 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion:

Conrad Colson took his own life whilst suffering from severe body dysmorphic disorder.
At the time of his death, he wos accessing aesthetic dermatology treatments; he was
not receiving a therapeutic level of medication and he was not i receipt of any
professional mental health support for his body dysmorphic disorder. He had been
discharged from mental health services without any robust rsk assessment and without
the safety nt of a fully considered risk management/relapse plan

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Conrad Colson suffered from severe body dysmorphic disorder (800). The symptoms
fom this condition had led toa serious suicide attempt in February 2020. In 2021,
following several months onthe wating list, Conrad received highly specialised therapy
fom the Centre for Anviety Disorders and Trauma (CADAT). He made significant
progress in managing his BOD symptoms during this therapy, however there was 2
known risk of relapse. He completed the sessions with his CADAT therapist in
November 2021. Before and during this therapy, he had als received support from his
local mental health trusts Peer Open Dialogue Team. As he had made such good
progress with CADAT and ashe had requested discharge from the Peer Open Dialogue
Team, he was also discharged from this team in Novernber 2021. There was no joint
‘mult-disciplinary risk assessment and risk management plan on discharge from the
teams. The practitioners were aware that Conrad was nat taking a therapeutic dose of
‘medication at the time of discharge, but no medical review was arranged for him. At
the time of discharge from services, Conrad was also accessing treatment from an
aesthetic dermatology clinic. This was not taken into account in is discharge risk
assessment, Conrad had raised concems with the skin clinic about his skin and the
treatment, in December 2020; January 2021; March and April 2021. On the 27 and 28

services attended and sadly Conrad was found deceased within is home address. The
evidence atthe inquest revealed that Conrad took his own life

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS
During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern
Inmy opinion there sa risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the
Circumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN areas follows:

1. Aconcem arose at the inquest hearing in relation to the absence of liaison
betwen the highly specialist services ofthe CADAT team and the stepdawn

‘services provided by NELFT. There was a lack of fullinformation sharing
around risk and joint risk assessment/rsk management planning on discharge

2, Both mental health services were aware that Conrad was accessing aesthetic
dermatology treatment. There was @ concern that neither service adequately
highlighted the risks of accessing such treatment to Conrad or attempted to
share information withthe skin cic. The inquest heard that patients with
{B00 should be fully informed ofthe risks of seeking aesthetic dermatology
treatment and wherever possible, clinics who are providing treatment should
bbe made aware ofthe BDD diagnosis.

3, The Inquest heard that there fe need for training tobe provided to step-down
service teams in relation to the diagnosis of BDD and the risks associated with
it

4, The inquest heard that there is lack of national resources for BDD. The highly
specialized service at South London and Maudsley has avery lang waiting list
(several months). Ths son a background of concerns of a ikely increase in
20D. In lght ofthis concern, | am alsa providing tis repart tothe Royal College

At the time of his death Samuel was suffering from alcohol addiction and had a diagnosis of ADHD and social anxiety. Prior to his death Samuel had received treatment from the Community Drug and Alcohol Treatment (‘CDAT’) team and primary mental health services. Samuel was discharged from CDAT fifteen months prior to his death. CDAT had information on their system (including from their own risk assessment) to indicate that Samuel had been assessed as a significant risk of suicide. There was other valuable information about Samuel’s risk factors on the CDAT system. At the time when Samuel was under CDAT the GP had also referred Samuel to the community mental health team raising his concerns about Samuel’s risk of suicide. It is not clear is CDAT had access to this letter. When the primary mental health services consultant began treating Samuel for his ADHD – which continued up to Samuel’s death – he received a referral from CDAT but he did not have access to the detailed information on the CDAT electronic system. The consultant could not and did not see the CDAT risk assessment, the outcome and assessment from the individual CDAT sessions and other vital historical information of potential relevance to Samuel’s risk factors and triggers for suicide.","During the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to a concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to make a report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013
 
The first MATTERS OF CONCERN is as follows:
I am concerned that in cases where an individual is receiving treatment from alcohol and drug addiction services and treatment from the primary community mental health team that neither team is able to access the other teams records electronically. The lack of integrated electronic records between treating team means that important information regarding patient safety is not easily accessible between treating teams. Treating teams are reliant on referral letters which are necessarily limited and not always sufficient to capture all the detailed information available to a referring team. This is particularly concerning where there is dual diagnosis – such as substance misuse and mental health – given these are often complex cases.

The prison in question now operates a local policy to ensure someone from the mental health team attends all ACCT reviews irrespective of other disciplines attending.

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise
to concer. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur
Unless action is taken. In the circumstances itis my statutory duty to
report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

The inquest heard evidence that GMP have guidance to support officers
in assessing risk and guiding actions when there Is a missing person
report. The evidence was that despite the existence of the
policyidocument the risk was not recognised as being high risk and the
appropriate actions were not taken immediately. The evidence indicated
that a number of factors were key in this failure to accurately assess the
risk. This included:

1. Poor understanding by GMP staff of the fact that a patient detained
on a voluntary basis in a mental health ward could stil be high risk
if they failed to return;

2. Lack of understanding by GMP staff that the use by mental health
Units of short periods away from the unit to support a patient's
recovery did not mean a patient could not be high risk if they did
not return;

3. Lack of understanding by officers of how to apply the golden hour
guidance and what was the expectation in terms of timeliness of
Undertaking the steps within the guidance coupled with a lack of
understanding by some officers of the way/cost to GMP in
accessing mobile phone data such as cell site; and

4. Poor quality documentation and information sharing between
officers and supervision in relation to information from the family
and the mental health unit.

The inquest was told that GMP had rolled out an Aide Memoire system to
tty to embed greater consistency and understanding of the policy across.
GMP. The Aide Memoires were recognised as being an effective tool
However, there was no evidence available to assist in understanding if
the Aide Memoires were being used effectively across the force and how
GMP were measuring the implementation of them,

Evidence was given to the inquest that GMP have introduced further
training on missing persons. However, the effectiveness of that training
was unclear given witnesses who had been on the training who gave
evidence remained of the view that Rebecca was not a high-risk missing
person despite all of the evidence available at the inquest

In December 2020 on a diagnosis of depressive illness incorporating psychotic symptoms, Mr Charles was made subject to an order under section 3 of the Mental Health Act 1983.
 
On 10th April 2021 Mr Charles was found unresponsive, suspended [REDACTED]
 on the mental health ward.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
1.     A failure to adequately assess risk of harm – Poor record keeping and a failure to read electronic records meant that important information was not considered at a Multi-Disciplinary Team (“MD T”) ward round on 6th April 2021. The MDT arrived at a conclusion that Mr Charles’ risk of self-harm was “no risk”. A psychologist’s assessment on the clinical record that assessed Mr Charles risk of self-harm as high on 31/3/21 was neither read nor incorporated into the MDT discussion.
 
2.     A decision to reduce observation frequency made by the MDT on 6/4/21 was not supported by the Trust Policy guidance which indicated that enhanced observations were appropriate.
 
3.     A failure to ensure that a treatment plan was followed – observations between
16.00 and 17.00 on the day of Mr Charles’ death were suspended by the ward shift co-ordinator. The decision meant all patients subject to general observation on the ward were ignored.
 
4.     Failures to respond to an emergency adequately – The Trust described the emergency response as chaotic . Staff agreed that they “panicked ” and did not follow policy, specific issues include;
a.     A ward emergency bell was not sounded,
b.     An anti-barricade key was not used to open Mr Charles’ door, instead the door was forced open causing a risk of harm to Mr Charles .
c.     A ligature cutter could not be used promptly as it was secured in a box with a combination lock – staff did not know the combination,
d.     Duty doctors were not called promptly,
e.     Oxygen administration was delayed,
f.       An on-site defibrillator was not used by staff
g.     Staff could or would not provide a clear and relevant history to paramedics.
 
5.     The credibility of evidence provided by Trust staff.
a.     Two Trust witnesses declined to answer questions put to them regarding whether their observation records were truthful.
b. Observation records appeared to have been created utilising a “cut and paste” function.
c. Records often inaccurately recorded the prescribed frequency of observation.
d. Factually inaccurate entries were made in the record following Mr Charles’ death. On 11th April 2021 an entry stated that Mr Charles was, “Awake in his bedroom sitting on his bede (sic)” at 07.21. On 12th April two entries made at 9.48 and 11.40 recorded that Mr Charles’ was alive and well. Senior Trust witnesses characterised these entries as dishonest.
 
6.     Governance process failings.
a.     A datix incident report created on the evening of 10th April 2021 by a senior nurse and Modern Matron contained misleading information that suggested that emergency response policies were followed when in fact they were not.
b.     The Datix failed to mention that observations had been suspended by the shift coordinator, a fact that was understood at that time. This obvious and significant piece of information that should have been escalated through the Trust governance team for action.
C. The Trust 72 hour report was written by the Modern Matron and was signed-off by an integrated care director on 15th April 2021. This document also failed to identify or escalate the significant issue of the suspension of observation at 16.00 on 10th April 2021.

‘overdose and suicidality. This was not recognised by the clinical team despite evidence
‘2valable in the electronic records, concerns raised by te fay and interment
gitation,
‘She was deemed to have reduced mental capac between 16° August 2020 and her
discharge for rehabilitation to Queen Mary's Hospital (QMH) on 18% August 2020, but
her bag was nat searched.

mvans she was foun io have capacty and again refused a bag search
(Overnight on 18% August 2020, she expressed sulcially to her family who netifed
nursing staff at MH

(On 20"" August 2020, this suicidality was explored by the SHO who found her not o be
actively suicidal and sought no advice rom the psychiati faison service

‘©n22"" August 2020, whist collateral pychiate Mstory was being sought ater she

| threatened sltcischarge a approximately 15:00 she took an overdose

Mrs Leaver was reagmited lo SGH and died there on ITU at 16:37 23° August 2020 as
‘result ofthe overdose.

‘The failures in care and communication together constitute
tonegiect.

Conclusion ofthe Coroner as tothe death:

‘total picture” that amounts

‘Mrs Leaver took her ow life whilst suffering from depressive illness. Her death
‘was contributed to by neglect.

‘ireumstances of the death.

Extensive evidence was taken and accepted by the cour. In summary, of relevance to
this report:

(On 14"" August 2020 Mrs Leaver attended SGH wit 3 odd episodes though tobe du to
TIA and discharged on asprin.

‘She re-attended wih a history ofa ft with a past history of epilepsy on phenytoin on 15%
‘August 2020 and was admitted to SGH under the medical team. The neurologist thought
italy that her phenytoin would be low and when was found to be inthe toc range
‘ascribed the fit to phenytoin toxic and she was admitted for monitoring, stopping
phenytoin, and restarting once levels back to normal

No acve consideration was given as fo the possible cause of tis toxicity, which could
hhave been due to overdose, given her psychiatric history as outlined below.

Despite being under active psychiatric care from the CMT for okfer persons, being on
‘psychiatric medication, taking a call from the CMHT whist an inpatient at SGH, having
{akon an overdose in November 2019, having multiple hospital attendances, including
47 July 2020 with suicidal ideation to Kingston, suffering agitaton, concems being
‘aisod about her mental health by her family, a safeguarding concern being raised
‘against her patnerriend, and intermittent agitation requting diazepam, 1:1 nursing, the
‘attendance of her son and hospital security and presenting with drug toxicity, psychiatric
liness was never considered. She was seen by multiple cinicians at SGH, none of
‘whom undertook any psychic history, or made any proper inquiry with her relatives,
hor of her electronic notes.

“This deprived her of aholaic assesament There was no referalo paychiatie aon
services, nor advice sought fom them at either st.

‘Mes Leaver therefore aid not havea selharm risk assessment despite her presentation
‘and past history, which would have likely prompfed more active searching of her
belongings for mediation which could be potentially used in an overdose. This could
have been undertaken even against her permission when she had reduced capacity in
her best intoress

‘Mrs Leaver had declined a bag search on admission to the ward t SGH which was
‘apparently passed on verbal tothe day team. Ths dd not appear to have been acted
Uipon and was not recorded, such that a search never occured

‘This was compounded by the fact that when psychiatric llness was aly being
considered at OMH from 20"" August 2020, there was only an informal telephone advice
{valiable, the quay of which varied withthe person who took the call, and anything
further required the anefer of Mrs Leaver back to SGH by LAS to ABE.

| understand thatthe NHS South West London integrated Care Board decined to
provide formal psychiatie cover to GMH, neither formal telephone advise nor staff on
Ste to see patents.

In evidence this was identified as a lacuna inthe service provision at GMH, by al the
‘liicians wth whom k was ciscussed, such that forth last 10 years psychiatric aison
hat been providing informal telephone advice without the need forthe patient to be
‘wansferrea back 0 ABE at SGH.

‘The Health information Exchange viewer, (HIE) avaliable to doctors wih in St Georges
Hospital Trust al the timo, contained a GP summary which didnot contain the recent
‘overdose of CMHT treatment as part of he active problem summary, nor even
‘epression ae a diagnosis despite a relapsing and remiting history of depression and
‘anwoty going back to 2006,

HIE dd contain sections of her RIO notes (psychiatric records) which appear to have
‘been missed and detals of attendence wth suicidal ideation at Kingston 19° July 2020,
which also appears fo have been missed or disregarded by the cinkians

Senior doctors in evidence were not ware of he information on the HIE

Instead the incomplete past medical history wich sted anxely and dementia appears
to have taken at face valve

‘As above, severe agitation at SGH did not prompt a reconsideration, neither did
tearfulness and low mood at OMM.

CConcermed phone cals from family were not logged nor passed to clinician untl she
‘expressed active sucdaly, and no doctor returned a cal othe family unt the daughter
Ineleted on the 22% August 2020 that if no docir called her back to ciscuss her
‘concerns about her mother she woul attend the hospital despite the pandemic.

By then itwas al too late.

‘The lack of paychatic history taking deprived Mrs Leaver ofthe opportunity for
psyehiarc liaison opinion and rsk assessment that would have been tkaly to have
{iscovered medication she had secreted in her bag that she subsequently consumed to
lethal efect

“This was despite the fact that for at least 2 out ofthe three days that she was at SGH
from 15° to 18% August 2020, she was found by nursing staf to lack full mental capacty.

TTundrstand that considerabe airing has now been given on his issue so that patents
\who lack capacity may have their Belongings searched to identily and secure dangerous
tems such as medeation.

‘There were also concerns that her sulidalty may have been exacerbated by drug
Interactions between phenytoin and diazepam. These matters have been addressed by
‘SGH in the raining fits clinicians,

Matiors of Concern

1. That the GP summary cid not contain pertinent psychiatric history that would
have assisted the hosptal cinilans to Kently Mrs Leaver's cepression and
specifically her suicidality

2. That doctors at SGH do not take a reasonable psychiatric history as par of thelr
Clerking and thus fall o make a proper holistic assessment ofthe patient and
Potential miss the opportunity fo manage risks such as those inthis case
which may lead to death

3. That doctors at SGH need training on the Information avallable on HIE and how
to access it

‘4, That NHS South West London integrated Care Board has made no formal
provision for psychiatric laison cover at OM, despite there being such a clear
‘inca need fortis thatthe team from psychiair liaison have fel compeled to
Provide informal telephone advice forthe fast 10 years.

5. That the lack of formal psychiatric advice availabilty at QMH puts vulnerable
aliens a increased risk, since the only way to properly access such advice is
for them to be sent by LAS ambulance to AGE at SGH, when they ae physically
‘ra, given that QM is @rehabiittion unit

When her baby was 11 months old she returned to work, but was signed off sick suffering from anxiety and depression. On the evening of the 14th March 2022 she was taken by her family to Kingston Hospital and assessed by the liaison psychiatric team. She expressed suicidal thoughts and plans [REDACTED].
 
She was diagnosed with postpartum depression. She was advised to become an informal patient in the NHS but there was no bed available so she would have had to wait in the hospital until a bed could be found. She decided to seek a private admission the following day.
 
On the 15th March 2022 she sought treatment at the Priory Hospital, Woking. She had a preadmission assessment with [REDACTED] a consultant psychiatrist who accepted her as a patient. She told him that she had a suicide plan but did not provide details of what it was. He assessed her as a high risk of suicide and set observations at four times an hour. She was allocated a Key Worker who was not due to be in the hospital until 22nd March 2022, and a Co-worker, who had a one-to-one with her on 19th March 2022. Her overall mental health appeared to have improved when she was reviewed by [REDACTED] on March 18th 2022. The observation level
was reduced to twice an hour on the 16th March 2022, and then further to
once an hour on the morning of March 21st 2022, on each occasion without a risk assessment being performed as specified in the Priory policy.
 
Later on the morning of the 21st March 2022 Miss Henderson made comments during a therapy session which indicated that her mental health was deteriorating. The therapists recorded what she had said in her notes, but the concerns were not considered to be serious enough to be escalated to the nursing team. Evidence presented to the inquest suggests that Amy’s observations should have been increased at this stage. Amy was not reviewed by the nursing team when the therapists’ notes were uploaded onto the system at 16.06 on 21st March 2022. The information was not reviewed and therefore not acted upon.
 
Miss Henderson was last seen in person at 18.02 in the dining room. At
18.12. she entered the downstairs disabled toilet. The disabled toilet had been identified in risk assessments as a high-risk area but it was not locked. She wrote a farewell note to her parents at 18.14. She was found in the disabled toilet on the ground floor at 20.01. She had taken her own life by suspension, [REDACTED].","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. Inmy opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
1.     The information that Miss Henderson had practised tying a ligature was divulged by her at Kingston Hospital but not repeated on admission to the Priory Woking. The evidence given at the inquest was that there is no quick method to obtain NHS records on admission to a private hospital. A request could have been made but the records would have taken over a week to be released. The records were not sought. An ability to obtain the NHS records quickly would have been of assistance to the Priory clinicians.
 
The Priory Woking has a policy in relation to the removal of banned and restricted items but there was a lack of clarity and confusion among the clinicians as to who was responsible for ensuring that such items are identified and removed from the patient at admission.",An inquest into the death of Miss Amy Henderson was opened on the 26th April 2022 and resumed with a jury on the 6th February 2023.

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

inquest into the death of Miss Amy Henderson was opened on the 26
{April 2022 and resumed with a jury on the 6 February 2023. The inquest
fas concluded on the 23"" February 2023. Evidence in respect of matters
ppertaining to this report was heard on the 20"" March 2023

[The jury concluded that Miss Henderson died on the 21% March 2022 at the|
Priory Hospital, Woking and the medical cause of her death was:

i1a Suspension
[They concluded with a narrative conclusion and found that:

|. The Priory staff knew Amy had suicidal ideation, but they did not know
;ny details conceming plans, or that she had practised tying a ligature.
2. No-one at the Priory asked her family about her suicide plans.

Itis not possible to determine what Amy would have said to her

ynsultant if she had been asked about suicide plans. Amy denied having
ny plans when asked by an HCA and she denied having thoughts of
suicide in her 1:1 with a SHCA.

lif Amy's mother had been asked, she would have shown the screen
shots from Amy's phone and given details of Amy practising tying ligatures.
[Amy's mother has no recollection of volunteering the information.

Despite the notes from the therapy sessions being uploaded at 16.06,
there was no formal request for Amy to be reviewed. There is evidence
rom professionals that Amy should have been reviewed urgently on the
sis of the notes, if they had been scrutinised.

If information about Amy practising tying a ligature had been known,
there would have been more consideration giver

— bearing in mind the balance of risk and least restrictive practice.

""1st March. Amy was generally compliant with staf,

77 After the identification of the disabled tollel as a high-risk area in 2021,
the ligature risk of the disabled tollet was not effectively managed although
the Priory considered that it was.

‘Amy had unrestricted access to the disabled toilet, which was accessible
to all patients, staff and visitors.
'9. The Jury was not able to make a finding as to whether Amy was alive
between 19.35 and 19.47.

In summary the following facts, on the balance of probabilities, made a
|material contribution to Amy Henderson's death:
Risk Assessments were not performed in line with Priory policy
bb. There was no Key Worker present throughout Amy's stay.
There were incomplete observations and little evidence of engagement
ith Amy during observations. Boxes were not ticked on Observation and,
Engagement Records.
The family was not consulted or questioned about Amy's Suicide Plans.
fe. Therapy notes were not acted upon,
‘There was a lack of staff training in Postnatal depression,
There was a lack of continuity of care.
jr The disabled tole was nt lacked
‘Staff knowledge of the ligature footprint was inconsistent.

Amy committed suicide. She used 2 Ig ligature and intended to kill
herselt Sheis shown on CCTV enietng the ceabed tolet and no-one else
tered it until Amy's body was discovered.

a risk assessment being performed as specified in the Priory policy.

Later on the morning of the 21* March 2022 Miss Henderson made
comments during a therapy session which indicated that her mental health|
was deteriorating. The therapists recorded what she had said in her notes,
but the concerns were not considered to be serious enough to be
escalated to the nursing team. Evidence presented to the Inquest suggest
that Amy's observations should have been increased at this stage. Amy
‘was not reviewed by the nursing team when the therapists’ notes were
uploaded onto the system at 16.06 on 21st March 2022. The information
‘was not reviewed and therefore not acted upon.

Miss Henderson was last seen in person at 18,02 inthe dining room. At

been identified in risk assessments as a highvsk area but it was not

| CORONER'S CONCERNS —S

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving
rise to concern. Inmy opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur
Unless action is taken. In the circumstances itis my statutory duty to
report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

1. The information that Miss Henderson had practised tying a ligature
was divulged by her at Kingston Hospital but not repeated on
admission to the Priory Woking. The evidence given at the inquest
was that there is no quick method to obtain NHS records on
admission to a private hospital. A request could have been made but!
the records would have taken over a week to be released. The
records were not sought. An ability to obtain the NHS records quickly}
would have been of assistance to the Priory clinicians.

2. The Priory Woking has a policy in relation to the removal of banned
and restricted items but there was a lack of clarity and confusion
‘among the clinicians as to who was responsible for ensuring that
‘such items are identified and removed from the patient at admission.

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and |
believe you(ANDIOR your organisation] have the power to take such
action.

JYOURRESPONSE

Yourate under a duty to respond to his report within 86 days ofthe date of
namely by 16 June 2023 |, the coroner, may extend the period.

During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving ise to concer. In
ry opinion there isa isk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken Inthe
circumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you,

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

1. SNHS Trusts and 3 police forces in diferent geographic areas had contact wth
Patrick in the final month of his life and each thereby gained some information
about the risk to him. However, tha information was by reason ofthe agencies
fang ito diferent geographic areas. There was no single elective global focus
for the information being acquired piecemeal about Patick’s pattem of sorious
se-harming behaviour. The various agencies were significantly impeded in
forming single clear pictur of Patricks patter of behaviour (hich was
paticlarly necessary in circumstances where he was nat engaging and
therefore not assisting in proving a complete history bimse).

2. GPs act asa repository for information about contact with other cinical agencies
(such as attendances at accident and emergency departments) and therefore
serve a8 a point f contat fr information about past history. However, | heard
‘evidence at inquest from accident and emergency consultants that itis ether not
possible to access information held by a GP practice out of GP surgery hours or
‘where it is possible to do so tha is only avaiable if the GP isin the same
‘geographic area asthe accident and emergency department. Soveral of

Palicksallendances at accent and emergency departments were out TGP
surgery hours

3. was informed at inquest that one local author (in whose area Pack resided)
had been made aware by police ofthe rik to Patrick folowing one of his sl
harm incidents (in respect of a particularly important plece of information) and
had relayed that information to 6"" NHS Trust (nat one of the from wich
heard evidence at inquest) but Patrick didnot reside in that Trust area. Those
“Trusts which did have direct contact with Patrick were naver made aware ofthat

piece of information nor had any means of accessing it

4. heard evidence that there is no national sk lagging’ system: for example,
when a person attends an accident and emergency department having elf
harmed, the fact of a previous seltharm atlendance ata diferent accident and
‘emergency departments not systematically lagged up

5. In summary, there was no single effective global focus consolidating the
information which was flowing inte the various agencies about Patrik; ne global
focus to which those agencies could in tur refer in emergency to aban the
totaly of information about Patrick's recent patter of behaviour; no national
risk tagging’ system to alert those agencies to his signfcant recent history.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

‘The Inquest heard evidence from the Head of Service for Safeguarding and Learing for
Stockport Metropolitan ‘Borough Counc. She ‘highlighted long-standing gap 10
provision, which was described as extending across most if not al local authorities, for
‘ulnerablo’ adults who have complex needs. but who do not fall into the existing
tramework of social services, Care Act provision or formal mental health supervision,
‘The effect ofthat gap fs that there is no identifable individual who ie a single pot of
contact in such cases equivalent to a social worker or care co-ordinator. The result is
that many vulnerable adults with complex needs have no such arrangements in place fr
contact, collating and sharing of information and deployment of services and assistance,
support or safeguarding. Where such arrangements are in place, they are necessarily
ad hoc in nature in diflering frameworks, levels and standards, and can devolve by
‘default to an individual wha, whilst welemotvated, may lack the skils and traning (©

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Lai Singh died at City Hospital on the 28"" January 2022 having been admitted after he
was found in cardiac arrestin his cell at HMP Birmingham on the 27"" January 2022. Mr.
‘Singh had asphyxiated due to placing a bag over his head. He received CPR from prison
staff and paramedics and was resuscitated but had suffered ireparable brain and organ
(damage.

Mr. Singh had been detained at HMP Birmingham on the 21% September 2021 whilst on
remand awaiting trial for the murder of his wife. From the time of his admission Mr. Singh's
family were concermed that he was suffering from a severe mental health condition and
raised this in numerous emails and telephone calls to safer custody. The content of cals,
land emails was not recorded on NOMIS casenotes forthe information of the custodial
team and was not consistently communicated to the mental health team. The information
that was passed to the mental health team was not clearly recorded in the SystemOne

Journal for all clinicians to see. Consequently, the opportunity to identify risk and open an
[ACCT document was missed.

From an early stage Mr. Singh was reporting psychotic behaviour to community
psychiatric nurses and was noted to be behaving unusually by custodial staff but he
(denied any active suicidal or sel-harming thoughts. His cellmate and a Chaplain raised
‘concems about his behaviour but still an ACCT book was not opened.

(On the 22nd November 2021 an ACCT book was opened after Mr. Singh reported wanting
to kill himself. The ACCT assessment, reviews and care plan were deficient leading to the
‘ACCT being closed prematurely on the 30th November 2021. The post closure process
Wwas also inadequate. During the time Mr. Singh was at HMP Birmingham he had a
‘number of welfare checks due to family concerns but these were superficial and
perfunctory and never carried out with an interpreter even though Mr. Singh's English was,
poor. Consequently, his risk was not adequately assessed.

Following an assessment on the 3""4 December 2021 a Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist
instructed by Mr. Singh's criminal defence team identified that Mr. Singh was suffering
With auditory hallucinations, low mood, tiredness and suicidal ideation and made a
diagnosis of schizophrenia with an effective element. The Psychiatrist made a referral to a
‘secure inpatient unit, The Hatherton Centre, for a transfer under section 48 of the Mental
Health Act. The referral was sent to the Hatherton Centre but was not sent to HMP
‘Birmingham straightaway. The referral to the secure unit was not accepted because it was.
imade by an independent psychiatrist rather than the prison's mental health team. The
‘mental health team at HMP Birmingham were, however, contacted on the 13th December
12021 by a psychiatrist from the Hatherton Centre who stated that there had been a
request for assessment for transfer and asked for further information. He was given
‘misleading information that Mr. Singh was ""coping wel"" and therefore informed the mental
health team that an assessment would not be carried out. No note was made of the
conversation withthe Hatherton Centre psychiatrist and no action was taken to investigate
land pursue a section 48 transfer. The information provided by the independent Consultant
Forensic Psychiatrist and the history of psychotic symptoms in SystemOne records ought,
to have resulted in an assessment by the Hatherton Centre. An assessment would have
been likely to result in section 48 transfer. Whilst Mr. Singh remained at HMP Birmingham
{awaiting transfer he ought to have been under the care of the mental health team and
housed on ward 2 (the mental health inpatient wing).

‘Mr. Singh continued to report that he was hearing voices, hallucinating, struggling to sleep
land low in mood. He was reviewed by GPs at the prison on the 29!"" November, 13!""
(December, 4"""" January and 25"" January who prescribed antidepressants and sleeping
imedication which Mr. Singh reported were not working,

(On the 14"" January 2022 a prison Consultant Psychiatrist determined that Jai Singh
required urgent admission to the inpatient psychiatric ward for assessment. However, the
‘admission was not facilitated and Mr. Singh remained on a residential wing. The decision
not to admit Mr. Singh to the ward was not recorded in his SystemOne records. Mr. Singh
‘received no further input or support from the mental health team, When he was seen by a
(GP on the 25th January 2022 it was identified that medication was not helping and Mr.
‘Singh needed to be seen by a psychiatrist but the GP thought he was going to be
transferred to Ward 2 and therefore took no further action.

{All actions taken following Mr. Singh being found in cardiac arrest on the 27th January 2022 were
‘appropriate.
Following a post morlem the medical cause of death was determined to be
41a. Hypoxicdschaomic brain damage

1b Multl-organ failure

‘16. Cardio-Pulmonary arrest due to asphyxia

(CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my
‘pinion there Isa risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances itis
imy statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN aro as follows. —

|. A multitude of factors contributed to Mr. Singh's death across the custodial and
healthcare teams within HMP Birmingham. Many steps have been taken by al
organisations with responsibilty for Mr. Singh's safety and health during his time at
HMP Birmingham to rectify failings that have been identified such as the consistent
failure to use interpreters, poor communication and record keeping within and
between teams, the absence of meaningful engagement with Mr. Singh's family,
insufficient consideration of family concerns and failings in the use of the ACCT
system,

2. Much ofthe evidence at the inquest focused on the central issue of repeated
missed opportunites to identify that Mr. Singh required admission to the prison's
inpatient ward, ward 2, and assessment for section 48 transfer to a medium secure
unit (which would have been likely to result in transfer to a medium secure unit.
The consequences ofthe failure to transfer Mr. Singh to an inpatient setting were
compounded by the fact that he was not taken onto the mental health team's
caseload promplly and therefore did not have the benefit ofan allocated CPN and
the oversight and input of a mental health mult-disciplinary team. Many steps have
been undertaken by Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust (who provide
‘mental health services within the prison) to minimise the risk of such a situation

3. However, tere are two features ofthe mental health care provided to Me. Singh
that create a risk tothe ives of others that have not yet been rectified:

i the fact that the mental health team mult-discipinary team (MDT) does not
include a psychiatrist; and

i. the absence of any ongoing risk assessment documentation for patients with
mental illness within the SystemOne records at HMP Birmingham,

4. In Mr. Singh's case itis my conclusion that itis likely that fa psychiatrist had been
at a mental health MOT meeting held on the 19th January 2022 they would have
identified that he needed to be admitted to ward 2 without further delay. At the very
least the need for urgent review by a psychiatrist and CPN would have been
recognised and facilitated which would in tum have led to admission. CPN in Mr.
Singh's case continually failed to identify the significance of repeatedly and
Consistently reported psychotic symptoms and consequently he did not receive
adequate assessment and treatment which increased his risk of self harm and
suicide which in turn was not sufficiently identified. The absence of a psychiatrist at
the MDT creates a risk that the significance of some symptoms and presentations
will not be recognised and further deaths could occur due to lack of appropriate
assessment and treatment

5. Other electronic health care records systems used in mental health settings have a

rolling risk assessment document that clinicians are required to review and update
at certain points in a patient's management. The risk assessment document
provides a prompt to clinicians to formally consider risk and come to a reasoned,
documented conclusion that then feeds into decision making. The record also
provides a reliable, easily accessible source of risk history. No such facility is in use
fon SystemOne at HMP Birmingham. Further, the evidence given was that such a
system is not being used routinely across mental health care within the prison
esate and is not provided as standard on SystemOne. This creates an ongoing risk
to life arising from under-estimation of risk as a result of clinicians not formally
considering and assessing current risk levels, and salient risk history not being
easily accessible. Itis understood by Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust
that it should be possible to create a specific risk assessment record within
‘SystemiOne and this is being considered locally. However, the evidence given was
that this issue should be highlighted nationally and that the developers and
distributors of SystemOne should be involved so as to ensure the best available
solution is identified,

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 
(1) During the 2½ years in which Charlotte’s mental health care was provided by the Trust, she had total of 8 different care coordinators. Furthermore, in those 2½ years there was a 5 month period when Charlotte had no appointed care coordinator at all. The care coordinator role is particularly important for a patient with such a complex case history as Charlotte.
 
I heard evidence that at the time of these events, the Trust had been experiencing an unprecedented level of instability, with many staff who might have been expected to fulfil care coordinator roles going off sick or even leaving the service. The witness who had conducted the Trust’s own internal investigation into these events gave evidence that one of the major reasons for this instability was that staff were unable to cope with ever-increasing workloads. The Trust’s Community Services manager for the Worcestershire Neighbourhood Teams appeared to corroborate this in his evidence, confirming that whilst national guidelines recommend a maximum of 30 patients per care coordinator, at the time of these events the Trust’s care coordinators had around 100 patients each. Whilst he was able to provide some reassurance that a recent recruitment drive has reduced individual care coordinator caseloads to around 25 patients, he was unable to explain how individual caseloads had been able to reach the levels they did at the time of these events, and was unable to give accurate figures as to current levels of staff sickness/absence.
 
I am concerned that the Trust is unable to understand fully how the care coordinator system failed at the time of these events, and that it is therefore not in a position to guard against a repeat of these circumstances in the future.
 
(2) The erroneous decision to pause Charlotte’s referral to the Priory Hospital for specialist treatment for Body Dysmorphic Disorder was taken by a senior clinician acting on her own, despite a Multi-Disciplinary Team meeting having decided that the referral was appropriate. When asked about how the senior clinician could have overridden the MDT decision, the Trust’s Community Services manager for the Worcestershire Neighbourhood Teams told the inquest that he could not say whether the senior clinician was not aware of the correct decision-making procedure, or whether she was, but chose instead to ignore it. When asked whether the same issue could arise in future, he told the inquest that he himself would be in a position to prevent the senior clinician making the wrong decision, but could not guarantee that he would be made aware of the issue so as to be able to do so.
 
I am concerned that the Trust has not properly established how the senior clinician was able to override the MDT decision, and does not have a sufficiently robust system in place to ensure that MDT decisions cannot be overridden in this way in future.","[the details below are fictional]   
On 27 July 2021 I commenced an investigation and opened an inquest into the death of Charlotte Comer. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 February 2023.   
The conclusion of the inquest was as follows:   ","In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you, as Chief Executive of the Herefordshire & Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust,
have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 8 May 2023. I, the coroner, may extend the period.

(027 July 2021 | commenced an investigation and opened an inquest into the death
‘of Charlotte Comer. The investigation concluded al the end ofthe inquest on 17
February 2023,

“The conclusion ofthe inquest was as follows:

“Charote Comer died as the resul of suicide. The following failings onthe part ofthe
Herefordshire and Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust (the Trust’) probably
caused or contributed to har death: a) The erroneous decision atthe beginning of
2021 to seek to pause Charlotte's referal tothe Priory Hospital for specialist
treatment for Body Dysmorphic Disorder; (o) The high tumover of care coordinators
for Charlotte whist she was under the Trust's care, together wth a five manth period
wen she was without a care coordinator a all which led faa lass of awareness on
the Truss part about the seriousness and complexity of Chafotte's needs: and (c)
The failure by the Trust o provide sufcient focus onthe important issue of Charfotte’s
‘ody Dysmorphie Disorder. Charlotte's death was contrbuted toby neglect.”

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

In answer othe questions ""when, where, how and in what circumstances did
Chariot come by her death”, | recorded a follows:

“On 18.721 Charlotte Comer, who ved wih 2 number of significant mental health
lisorders, including Body Dysmorphic Disorder, and had a known history of afampts
a suicide and sol-harm, lot Worcestershire Royal Hospital bofore doctors there could
treat a substantial, recent seltinficted wound fo her upper arm. She returned intally
to her parents’ home, before then making her way to her own adress in Worcester,
where she proceeded ta take a substantial overdase of Propranolol and Amlodipine

CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS.

| make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 6, of the Coroners and Justice
‘Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 28 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations
2013.

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

On 2 September 2019 an investigation was commenced into the death of
Sharon Elizabeth LANGLEY, aged 62 years. Sharon Elizabeth Langley died on
the 10 August 2019. The investigation concluded at the end of the 10-day
inquest on 21 February 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was Suicide with
narrative with a medical cause of death of ‘fa Immersion in Water (Drowning) 1
Severe Depressive Disorder with Psychosis.

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

(On 10 August 2019 at the Princess Alexandra Hospital, Hamstel Road, Essex,
Sharon Elizabeth Langley an inpatient with Severe Depressive Disorder and
Psychosis died by Immersion in Water unsupervised in an assisted bathroom on
(Chelmer Ward.

Following several documented suicide attempts the latest on 7 July 2019
‘Sharon Elizabeth Langley took the actions to immerse herself in the water in the
bath and did so with the intention to end her life. Therefore, we return a
conciusion of Suicide with the following additional narrative. Sharon was taken
for a supervised bath and access was granted by staff to the bathroom at
09:33:57. The evidence shows staff who should have been assisting Sharon
were in other places on the ward atthe time of her bath, suggesting she was left
alone and unsupervised. Although nat formally dacumented evidence was heard
‘Sharon should be assisted whilst having a bath

‘Sharon was found face down and unclothes in a bath with water at around 10am

by the healthcare assistants who pulled her out ofthe bath and laid her on the
floor next to the bath. Initial staff response was inadequate and insufficient
causing a delay in triggering the pinpoint alarm and ambulance being called.
However, when nurses arived emergency treatment was adequate with
evidence showing the AED was used correctly.

Paramedics arrived on the scene within 3 minutes to take over emergency aid
The paramedics lacked information about the incident from staff and Sharon,
was taken to the Accident and Emergency department at 10:39 where she was,
declared dead,

CORONER'S

CONCERNS,

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to
concer. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action
is taken. Inthe circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows, —

(1) Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust staff immediate emergency
response was not followed:

‘a. pinpoint alarms were not activated immediately on finding Sharon
Langley unresponsive

b. there was a delay calling the ambulance and basic key information
about the type of the emergency was not relayed:

| by qualified nurses who made the 999 calls, or
ILto paramedics on attendance

©. there was a delay informing the site co-ordinator of the emergency
leven though she was based on the ward and there was a lack of co-
ordination of the emergency resulting in the ambulance being called
a second time by the site co-ordinator

d._ staff trained in basic life support did not assist the two nurses who
were attempting to resuscitate Sharon Langley

(2) There was a difference in the safety measures fited to the bathroom
door on the adjoining Stor Ward that had a self-closure mechanism at
the time of Sharon's death. This mechanism has now been fitted to
Chelmer Ward. There is a concern that safety information is not shared

‘across the Trust and known risks are not miigaied appropriately.

(3) The Trust was on notice of issues on Chelmer ward with doors to high-
risk areas not closing that included the Staff Room and Patient
‘Storeroom.

a. At the time of Sharon's death, the mitigation on the ward was for staff to
push doors to see if they were locked, this was action even though
fevidence was heard that these doors had keylocks and staff had keys
that could have been used.

. The Patient Storeroom contains items removed from patients as they
ose a significant sel-harm risk andlor suicide.

Staff Room that contains items that pose a risk to patients,

Salfclosure mechanisms have not been fitted to these doors in a high-
risk environment of a secure psychiatric ward even though the risk is
known. Evidence was heard from patient safoty that itis sufficient to
have maintenance manually adjust doors if there are closure issues.

(4) Chelmer Ward staff did not always report door closure issues either on
the ward to the Nurse in Charge or to maintenance. Following the death
ff Sharon Langley there has been no training on how to report door
closure issues reported,

(8) Evidence was heard that the bath plug was required to be kept in the
ward office when not in use as the bathroom was a high-isk area. There
was no evidence that staff had to obtain this from the office on the day
Sharon Langley died. There stil appears to be confusion around the
requirement.

(6) There is concem about the reliability ofthe Trust investigation and how
the Trust learns lessons. The investigation report did not:

‘a. scrutinise the movements of staff even though the door logs were
avalable or raise any issues for further investigation

b. alse any issues around the bath plug or where it should be kept

©. investigate concems raised around the Trust staff emergency
response or failure to provide basic Information on the incident to
paramedics

(7) The Trust investigation author changed the conclusion of his report
during the inquest when he received statements provided by staff that
were not requested and contained timing information that in evidence

‘laf stated they did not know.

(8) Quality of record keeping was not deemed to be appropriate by senior
staff during evidence:

a. Significant examples of cut and paste including out-of-date risk
information at al grades of ward staff, and

omissions in muti-disciplinary decision-making and risk of self-harm
with no rationale for the level of observations set for the patient and a
plan for how risks should be managed

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you
‘and your organisation have the power to take such action.

YOUR RESPONSE

You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days ofthe date ofthis
report, namely by Monday 24 April 2023. |, the coroner, may extand the period.

Shortly after thi time, Anthony's vehicle was found ina carpark mare than two miles from

the search ofthe car par area had falls to locate him, they returned to te sacond home

Poor communication between the Metropolitan Police and Suffolk Constabulary meant that

te | concluded on 1 December 2022 wth a narrative conetusion ""He died as 2

4 | CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

1. Stefan suffered fom autem and was at schoo! at Laleham gop where he had
been since Apri 2013. He had annual reviews of his placement a he school and
‘was doing well and a he start ofthe winter 2020 term had managed to obtain a
pat time job and was considering caraer options of ether the amy or food
industy. He had an extremely supportive family and parents who made significant
‘efforts to ensure that he had access tothe support he needed.

2. Both his parents and his school noted a deci in his mental heath in December
2021 and he mot with the Schoo! alongside his parents and his timetable was
“amended and steps to obtain addtional support considered. On 14° January
2022 he tld a member of staff at school that he had contacted the National
Suicide Prevention helpline but later appeared to deny tis. He apparently cid not
‘express any intent to harm himself but did express feelings of being low:

3. His parents, having tied to see what help was available lay, took stops to ty
'o arrange private counseling and arranged for this to start after the February half
term, The service the family approached did not consider Stefan was suitable for
short frm counseling and advice was given to approach his General
Practtioner(GP), On 15” March 2022 Stefan's Mum spoke to his GP and asked
fora ltter to apply for funding fom specific autism related counseling which his
CGP did but this was rejected and the letor received on 17 March 2022. At the
onsullaton which occurred onthe telephone betwen Stefan’s mother and his

‘GP there was ne mention of suicidal Weation or seitharm, On Sunday 20"" March
Stefan was found hanging at home in hi bedroom by his family and he was taken
to hospital and subsequently transferred to Kings Collage hospital where sadly he
ied on 26"" March 2022

4. Inthe course of hearing the evidence it was coar that local mental health services
wore considered tobe accessible va a Single Point of Access and that anyone

‘could refer inthis way and the healthcare provider would then screen any referral

which wass made and possibly provide treatment. However such a referral was not
made for Slefan because it was not clear that this was avaiable to Stefan’s family
‘who would have taken whatever sleps they could have done o ensure
appropriate support His General Practitioner was aware ofthe Single Point of
‘Access and that there were groups avaiable but wats for specific services for
those with autism in her experince were atleast 3 months and instead she
referred him toa diferent service at South London and the Maudsley which she
‘considered may better suit his needs. The referral was ejected but the
‘correspondence on this only came to light after Stan's sad death

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise fo concer. In
my opinion there sa risk thal future deaths could occur uniess action is taken In the
CGreumstances it is my statulory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

1. During the course of the inquest reference was made tothe National Institute for
Cnical Excellence (NICE) guidance “Autistic Spectrum disorder in under 198:
support and management.” Pubished on 28 August 2073 and in partioular
paragraph 1.1.4 which states that “Local autem teams should ensure that every
child or young person diagnosed with auism has a case manager or key worker
to manage and coordinate treatment, care, support and transition o adult care in
line withthe NICE guideline on autism in children and young people (covering
‘dentitication and diagnosis)"" Stefan dd not have a case manager or key worker.

2. am unable to say ifthe lack of @ case manager or key worker caused or
Contibuted more than mirimally to Stefan's death but had one been available
they may have been able fo asset Stefan and his family to navigate the services
available which in turn may have led to intervention which may have made a
iference. | am prohibited from returning a conclusion which comments on issues
where ther is no clear causal link with the death however the Coroners and
Justice Act 2009 creates a duty an Coroners to report an issue which gives rise to

‘a concer which may lad to future deaths.

3. asked for futher evidence on the provision of case managersikey workers in
‘accordance with the NICE guidance after the inquest from North East Londen
Foundation Trust and from Kent and Medway intograted Care Board. tis clear
from the evidence provided that such a service is only provided to those under 19
‘year olds wh have both a learning disability andlor a diagnosis of autism and are
‘at risk of admission to a mental health hospital or where there i a significant
sudden deterioration inthe community and the multi disciplinary team has not
been responsive. The lowest level of service outine in reply tothe court
indicated that referals could be made to a key worker to sign post families not
that they would have a key worker allocated to them, This sets the bara a level
hich means large number of young people witha leaming disbiity andlor
autism would not have @ key werker nor would they be expected to have one

4. Inthe evidence provided it was outined that “Keyworkers wil make sure that
these children, young people and families get the right support atthe right time.
They wi make sure that local systems are responsive fo ly meeting the young
people's needs in ajoined-up way and that whenever it is possible fo provide care
and treatment in tho community withthe right support this becomes the norm.” If
‘every autistic cid or young person had a key worker this would enable them or
their family the opportuniy to aise with their Key Worker rather than having to ry
to navigate sonvices themselves. This in tun, may prevent others from
‘encountring the issues faced by Stefan’ family and ultimately prevent future
deaths.

“ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN
In my opinion action shouldbe taken to prevent future deaths and | beiove you have the
‘power fo take such action.

‘Aria's first home leave folowing the second overdose was on 18 June 2021. When she returned
from leave that evening, Ania was searched by a mental health support worker who confiscated two
belts from her bag. Ania denied having any other contraband items on her person. There is no
documented evidence of the two belts having been found on Ania that evening or that this was
handed over to the nurse in charge of the shil. The nurse in charge of the shift has no recollection
‘Of being informed ofthe two belts or of undertaking a posteave assessment. The entry within the
Day notes does not evidence whether or not a posteave assessment cd in fact take place that |

‘Ania collapsed in the lounge area of Grifin Ward at lunch-time the following day. She was on 1:5

she was alright.

Following her collapse, Ania was conveyed to North Manchester General Hospital where attempts

|

CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion
there is @ risk that future deaths will occur uniess action is taken. In the circumstances itis my
statutory duty to report to you.

OF Con ‘nro i bing are as 2

(1) Whilst each individual pharmacy had in-house safety checks to safeguard against over.
prescribing by their own pharmacy, there is no integrated system in place which would alert a
prescriber to prescriptions that have been dispensed by other on-line pharmacies. As a result,
itis currently possible fora patient to obtain excessive quantities of medication by simply |
placing multiple orders with different on-ine pharmacists.

(2) There is no requirement for the on-iine pharmacies to share information withthe patients GP.
‘This means that, inthe absence ofthe patient's consent to share information, the online
prescriber is reliant on the accuracy and truthfulness of the history provided by the patient

(3) Lack of information sharing also creates a risk that a GP or Pharmacist Prescriber may
‘unwittingly prescribe a medication that Is contraindicated with a medication that has been
dispensed through an or-ine pharmacy.

Mas rovisio health ws
as follows:

(1) The Recovery & Discharge Pans contained inaccurate information regarding Ania's consent to
share information with her mother. The evidence was that this was an entry made in errorin |
‘June 2020 and was not picked up by any of the nurses who updated the Recovery & Discharge
Pian over the subsequent 11 months.

(2) The Recovery & Discharge Plans did not address the risks associated with Ania's procurement |
‘of Propranolol from orvline pharmacies. The evidence was that an update of the Recovery &
Discharge Plan involved members of nursing staff simply adding a note that the overdoses had |
taken place. The Plan did not show that any meaningful thought had been given to addressing
the particular risk associated with the procurement of on-line medication.

(8) Mandatory refresher training on basic aspects of nursing care such as record keeping,
‘searches, care-planning, undertaking pre- and postleave assessments and confidentiality is
‘not provided to staf.
""] (4) There is no requirement for the outcome of negative personal searches to be documented in

‘rintone ac tence ba horas harks ss

(6) Documentation on which 1:5 observations are recorded does not evidence that a check has
taken place every 5 minutes. Instead the current documentation, simply requires one signature
per hour. There is therefore no mechanism by which observations can be effectively audited.

(7) There is no requirement to make a separate enity evidencing that @ posteave assessment has
been undertaking. The posteave assessments are currently subsumed within Day Noles and
do not cleary state whether an assessment was undertaken, what was discussed and the
‘outcome of the assessment

She had had a 35 year history with mental health services. Samantha arrived at Sturdee Community Hospital (a locked female rehabilitation ward) in June of 2020, when her community placement had broken down and she could no longer be safely managed within the community.   ","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern)
1. Emergency Response
 
I heard during the course of the inquest that when an alarm sounded staff would attend the location of the alarm, assess the situation and then go and collect what equipment may be necessary to deal with the emergency.
 
At the time of Samantha’s death there was only 1 emergency bag for the entire hospital (which had 2 wards and separate self-contained flats on the site). This has now been rectified and there is an emergency bag for every ward.
 
Staff partake in a drill and evidence provided to me for the purposes of Regulation 28 showed that response times of staff remain at 2 minutes to a patient’s side.
 
However, I was told that the emergency response still has staff attend a patient, assess and then go and collect the emergency bag, rather than taking it immediately to the patient’s side.
 
I was provided with evidence for the purposes of Regulation 28 by Inmind Healthcare Group which showed, for example, that in December of 2022 there were 64 incidents, 45 of which were self-harm, 2 of which were clinical incidents. 16 resulted in actual harm and a large number of those incidents concerned patients ligating.
 
To continue with an emergency response which delays the provision of life saving equipment to the patients’ side is unsafe and in my opinion could lead to future deaths.
 
The delay in providing CPR to Samantha on balance had no causative effect on her death, but it could for another patient.
 
2. Observation Policy
 
At the time of Samantha’s death observations were conducted and recorded in a predictable and prescriptive way by healthcare staff. The quality of observations recorded at the time of Samantha’s death were such that they did not accord with the expectation of the policy and merely recorded where the patient was and what they were doing.
 
Effective observations were acknowledged as being a vital tool to assess and manage the risk of a patient.
 
Inmind Healthcare Group’s new observation Policy states:
 
‘Observations are a therapeutic intervention aimed at reducing factors which contribute to increased risk and promoting recovery. The use of enhanced observation levels should never be regarded as routine practice…….
Observation practice must focus on engaging the person therapeutically and enabling them to address their difficulties constructively. Our interactions must seek to create rapport which allows those in our care to feel valued and safe to share their experiences with us’.
 
Since Samantha’s death changes have been made by Inmind Healthcare Group to their policy and practice, in that observations are now recorded at the precise time they are conducted and are infrequent in their predictability (eg: hourly observation should be conducted once hourly rather than on the hour every hour).
 
Evidence of recent observation records demonstrated that this was now practice.
 
However, there was a disconnect between the new policy and the pre-printed forms being used to record observations; what staff were being instructed to do and what they were recording.  This was confusing and the evidence produced did not support the expectations of the new policy or demonstrate it had become embedded practice. The evidence produced did not support a change in staff recording quality observations, so that whilst precise and intermittent timings were evidenced, beyond the location of the patient or what they were doing, the actual presentation of the patient was not being recorded.","On 29 October 2021, I commenced an investigation into the death of Samantha Jane BOAZMAN aged 54. The investigation concluded at the end of a 10 day inquest on 27 January 2023.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by March 27, 2023.

3 | INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(029 October 2021, l commenced an investigation into the death of Samantha Jane
BOAZMAN aged 54. The investigation concluded at the end of 210 day inquest on 27 January
2023. The conclusion of the jury was:

‘Death by misadventure. We find that there was gross neglect due toa continuous sequence
of shortcomings, including a lack of adequate training an the rsks and triggers of patients
Foallure to remove ligature risks from bedrooms. Inadequate induction ond training of
temporary staff.

| CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Samantha Boazman had a diagnosis of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder and
Dissocial Personality Disorder. She had had a 35 year history with mental health services.
‘Samantha arrived at Sturdee Community Hospital (a locked female rehabilitation ward) in
June of 2020, when her community placement had broken down and she could no longer be
‘safely managed within the community

{At the time of her death, Samantha was detained under 5.3 ofthe Mental Health Act
(On 17” September 2021 whilst on 5.27 leave Samantha walked in front of a slow-moving
vehicle, she was admitted to AKE with 2 minor injury to her knee and head injury where she

had fallen backwards, She was discharged the same day.

‘On return to Sturdee Community Hospital Samantha was placed on 15 minute observations

bout was found in her batheaom
Samantha wae

moved toa safety room.

Decent Tone Ups SOOT RET
(0n 14 October 2021 Samantha returned to her normal bedroom, room 5.

‘Observation levels were reduced from 15 minutes to 30 minutes on 22"" and 22” September,
land then reduced to hourly observations on 23"" September 2021. The RAG rating records
‘Samantha as being on hourly observations from 23° September to the date of her death

‘On 20"" September 2021, Samantha was denied access to ‘cables/chargers. The Jury heard
‘evidence that something coloured red an the RAG rating was a ‘igh risk’. Cables/chargers
‘were highlighted red and remained contraband items from 20"" September to the point of
‘Samantha's death

‘Samantha found transitions difficult to go somewhere she didn't know. On 21"" October 2022
‘Samantha was informed that she would be moving to Aylestone Flats within the ground of
Sturdee Community Hospital in preparation for moving to the community in the future, A
Senior Registered MHN told the Jury thatthe thought of moving destablised Samantha,

Samantha had heightened sensitivity as part of her Emotionally Unstable Personality
Disorder, so a small thing (not receiving a text message) would be felt more strongly. Her
Psychologist saw Samantha on the 21"" October and described Samantha as anxious and the
reasons for this were not receiving responses to her text messages and also leaving the
hospital fora future placement (yet tobe identified),

‘Samantha had been more agitated than usual over the course of the previous week and
seeking staff support quite alot.

No one could recall a discussion about Samantha's risk at the risk management meeting of
22% October 2021 and if there was a discussion about Samantha’ isk, her risk rating wasn’t
changed on the RAG document.

Various staff gave evidence as to Samantha's presentation on the 22% October 2021, for
‘example: Samantha was at around 3pm almost irtable; very unsettled and had been more
‘agitated in the days prior to her death and seeking more 1-1 interactions. Samantha was
described as unsettled, kept pacing and crying, this was different to what Samantha was like
before. Samantha was said tobe ‘very very’ anxious walking up and down asking for the
doctor or the nurse in charge,

‘The CTY evidence of Samantha on 22 October 2021 between 15.57 hours and 17.33 hours
(when Samantha was last seen) showed that between 15.57 and 16.29 hours Samantha can
be seen pacing the corridor 27 times within the 32 minute period, and between 16.29 and
17.33, a 64 minutes period, she can be seen pacing the corridor 70 times ~ mare than 1 x per

Health care assistants who were allocated general observations would be allocated these
within a Ichour perio, for example 4pm to Spm. The Jury heard how healthcare assistants
had to observe and record the hourly observation fora patient onthe hour every hour, none
were told to record the actual time they observed the patient, nor was that the Inmind
Healthcare Group Policy for Sturdee Community Hospital in place at the time. Healthcare
‘assistants would locate the patient S minutes before the hour period was up and then record
their abservation onthe hour and then move t ther next patient.

Decent Tone Ups SOOT RET
[As far as the purpose of conducting observations, the evidence ofthe healthcare assistants
was that they needed to observe thatthe patient was safe and if the patient was sleeping, to
check ifthe patient was breathing. Health care assistants were to record the location and
‘what the patient was doing and als to record if the healthcare asistant interacted withthe
patient and anything else meaningful. If 2 patient was engaged with something (e:
‘watching ty) there wasn't an expectation to disturb the patient to interact with them.

‘There was a period of 1 hour and 12 minutes between Samantha closing her bedroom door
land it being opened by a healthcare assistant and no was seen entering Samantha's room
during that time. No one observed her.

‘Samantha was found at 18.45 hours in her bathroom on 22nd of October 207

‘Anurse and hesltheare assistant answered the alarm at 18.47, just under 2 minutes. There
‘were difficulties in entering Samantha's bathroom because she was behind the door.

‘The 999 call to East Midlands Ambulance Service was received at 16.53 hrs, 8 minutes after
the alarm was raised,

{Atrained paramedic co-incidentally arrived at the hospital to work ina eifferent capacity and
‘went to assist arriving at Samantha's bedroom at 18.53 hours, the same time as the 999 call
was being made, The Jury hard in evidence that there was no CPR in progress when she
arrived. The paramedic sid that ILS training was that you should commence early CPR.

‘The emergency response bag was delayed in being brought to the scene due to being
situated on a different ward which required access to another building through locked doors.
‘The defirilator was being attached during the 999 call and at the point the trained
paramedic arrived at the scene.

(CPR was commenced ata time a least 8 minutes after the alarm was raised, and at atime at
least 6 minutes after the alarm was answered. The defibrillator advised no shock indicating
that there was no electrical activity within Samantha's heart (asystole). A second round of
(CPR as advised by the defirilator, was commenced, but Samantha's pupils were fixed and
dilated, she had mottied skin, which she described was a bruising effect when the body has
ben lying for some time and as advised by the Resuscitation Council UK, CPR was ceased to
preserve Samantha's dignity.

Paramedics attended and Samantha was pronounced dead at 19:15 hours.

“CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course ofthe investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving ise to concern In
ry opinion there sa risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. Inthe
CGreumatances itis my statutory duty to report to you

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN areas follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)

Decent Tone Ups SOOT RET
1._-Emergency Response

heard during the course of the inquest that when an alarm sounded staff would attend the
location ofthe alarm, assess the situation and then go and collect what equipment may be
necessary to deal with the emergency

[At the time of Samantha's death there was only 1 emergency bag forthe entire hospital
(which had 2 wards and separate self-contained flats on the ste). This has now been rectified
‘and there i an emergency bag for every ward

‘taf partake in a dril and evidence provided to me forthe purposes of Regulation 28 showed
‘that response times of staff remain at 2 minutes toa patients side

However, Iwas told that the emergency response still has staf attend a patient, assess and
then go and collect the emergency bag, rather than taking it immediately tothe patients
side,

| was provided with evidence for the purposes of Regulation 28 by Inmind Healthcare Group
which showed, fer example, that in December of 2022 there were 64 incidents, 45 of which
were sel-harm, 2 of which were clinical incidents, 16 resulted in actual harm and a large
numberof those incidents cancerned patients ligating.

‘To continue with an emergency response which delays the provision of fe saving equipment
to the patients’ side is unsafe and in my opinion could lead to future deaths.

‘The delay in proving CPR to Samantha on balance had no causative effect on her death, but
it could for another patient

2. Observation Policy

{At the time of Samantha's death observations were conducted and recorded in a predictable
‘and prescriptive way by healthcare staff. The quality of observations recorded at the time of
‘Samantha's death were such that they didnot accord withthe expectation ofthe policy and
merely recorded where the patient was and what they were doing,

Effective observations were acknowledged a: being a vital tool to assess and manage the risk
of patient.

Inmind Healthcare Group's new observation Policy states:

“bservatins ae a therapeutic intervention aimed a educing factors whlch contribute te creased
ric and prometing recovery. The use of enhanced observation levels sould never be regarded a=
‘outine pace

‘Observation practice must focus on engaging the person therapeutically and enabling them to adress
thelr dficutes constructively. Our interaction must seek to create rappart which allows thoes in ur
‘care tofel valued and safe to share ther experlances with us

‘Since Samantha's death changes have been made by Inmind Healthcare Group to ther policy

Decent Tone Ups SOOT RET
‘and practice, in that observations are now recorded at the precise time they are conducted
‘and are infrequent in their predictability (eg: hourly observation should be conducted once
hourly rather than on the hour every hour)

Evidence of recent observation records demonstrated that this was now practice.

However, there was a disconnect between the new policy and the pre-printed forms being
used to record observations; what staff were being instructed to do and what they were
recording. This was confusing and the evidence produced didnot support the expectations
‘of the new policy or demonstrate ithad become embedded practice. The evidence produced
did not support a change in staff recording quality observations, so that whist precise and
intermittent timings were evidenced, beyond the location of the patient or what they were
doin, the actual presentation ofthe patient was not being recorded.

I make this report under paragraph 7(1) of Schedule 5 to The Coroners
and Justice Act 2009.

3. | INVESTIGATION and INQUEST
The inquest into the death of Zachary KLEMENT was opened on 18%
March 2021. Evidence was heard between 4 and 6 October 2022, and it
‘was concluded on 2°! December 2022.

| found the medical cause of death to be:

1a, Suspension

I determined that Zachary took his own life by suspension during a crisis,
of deteriorating mental health and increasing suicidal ideation. I recorded
a narrative conclusion, detailing the following:-

On 20 March 2021, Zachary Klement was found suspended in his
bedroom at his supported living accommodation in Woking, Surrey, and
‘wus pronounced deceased by attending paramedics at 19:37. He had a
long history of mental health issues from childhood and was diagnosed
with Autistic Spectrum Disorder, Emotionally Unstable Personality

Disorder, general anxiety disorder and Bipolar Affective Disorder.

(On 26% January 2021, Zachary was admitted to Farnham Road Hospital
1s an informal patient following an escalation in his selfsharm and
suicidal ideation. He was discharged back to his supported ling
accommodation on 1 February 2021, initially under the care of the
Home Treatment Team and then the Community Mental Healt
Recovery Service. He continued to have fluctuating mood and episodes of|
self-harm, and he sought help from Safe Haven and the Psychiatric
Liaison Service at St Peter's Hospital on 4"" 22 24° and 28° February

On the last occasion, 28 February 2021, he expressed concern he could
not keep himself safe. He requested inpatient admittance and then agreed
to Home Treatment Team care before changing his mind. On this
occasion his immediate risk was assessed as low and he was discharged
back to the Community Mental Health Team. This was a missed
opportunity to contain and manage his risk whilst exploring his needs

The lack of availabiity of psychological therapies and resources tailored to
the needs of patients with Autistic Spectrum Disorder which could be
offered to Zachary by Surrey & Borders Partnership NHS Foundation
Trust also represented a missed opportunity to provide therapeutic cae.

On the afternoon of 2 March, Zachary sent a text message to his Care
Coordinator stating that he wanted 10 discharge himself from mental
health services as he felt they were not helping him. A support worker
found him suspended in his bedroom at around 18.45. Suicide.

| CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Zachary was found suspended in the bedroom of his supported accommodation
fon 2° March 2021, and was pronounced deceased by attending paramedics.

5 | CORONER'S CONCERNS
‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are:

= Zachary had a history of mental illness from childhood. His
diagnosed conditions of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and

Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder required care tailored
to his neurodiverse needs. Concern was expressed by two
Consultant Psychiatrists who cared for him in life, and the Court
appointed Expert Consultant Psychiatrist, regarding the lack of
consideration for those with neurodiverse conditions in the care
options available, and the lack of availability of appropriate
therapies;

= Inpatient mental health units adversely affect those with
neurodiverse conditions since they require calm and structure.
There are no inpatient options tailored to patients with
neurodiverse conditions presenting in acute crisis;

= Home Treatment Teams do not offer continuity of staff or set
appointment times, as they are a crisis team allocated according to
demand. This stability is required by those suffering from ASD;

+ There is a lack of availability of psychological interventions, being
the main treatment for neurodiverse conditions, including art
therapy, Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) and Systems
Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving
(STEPPS) (Zachary was placed on a waiting list)

Consideration should be given to whether any steps can be taken to
address the above concerns.

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(On 10 February 2022, one of my assistant coroners, Jonathan Stevens,
commenced an investigation into the death of Andrew Mark Largin, aged
60 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest last
Friday, 20 January 2023.

I made a determination at inquest that Andrew Largin died by suicide.
His mental health had been identified as deteriorating by a community
rehabilitation team on 1 February 2022. That team nolified the home
treatment team who had discharged him from their care on 25 January
2023. However, the home treatment team failed to reassess him.

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Mr Largin asphyxiated himself in the early hours of 6 February 2022, at
the home of is sister and brother in law where he lived,

His medical cause of death was:
1a) asphyxia
1b) inhalation of inert gas

CORONER'S CONCERNS.

During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Sean Duignan was arrested on the 29th May 2021 and taken to Milton Keynes Police Station where he was detained and released under investigation the next day, Sunday 30th. That seems to have been a likely trigger for Sean to take his own life.
The next day he was on leave and went to the Luton Airport Police base where the Southern Armoury was located. He was the Armed Response base sergeant.
Sean entered the equipment room, where the manual override keys to the armoury were located in a locked box secured by a PIN. Officer [REDACTED] who were present in the equipment room said Sean appeared startled to find them there. He remained cheerful and engaged in cheeky banter [REDACTED] was of the view that Sean entered so that he could access the armoury key.
Sean, discovering his access to the override key was blocked asked one of the officers to second him into the armoury. By chance, it was [REDACTED] who agreed and went with Sean to the armoury. She had been given single access by error systems failure some time previously. Sean applied his armoury and entered his PIN. It failed. [REDACTED] and used her card and PIN.

certain, have allowed him entry.","On 10 June 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Sean Gerard DUIGNAN aged 44. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 14 November 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was that:
 
Sean Gerard Duignan was a well respected, well liked and universally helpful base sergeant at the Luton Airport Armed Policing Unit (South Base). On the 29th May 2021 he was arrested following reports of a vehicle being driven erratically and dangerously. A Bedfordshire Police sergeant visited him at his home to conduct what was initially to be a welfare check. Sean was intoxicated with alcohol and was arrested and taken into custody on suspicion of drink or drug driving. He remained in custody until the following afternoon when he was released under investigations. Multiple and serial enquiries were made by members of the custody and health care staff at Milton Keynes Police Custody suite to determine his mental health and to keep him safe. Those checks were repeated on release. They were continued by the police federation representatives and his close friend [REDACTED]. All seemed well. The next day, a day off, Sean travelled to the Luton Airport Armed Policing Unit where the South Base armoury is located. The armoury security was lax and had been for a prolonged period. The computer system used for electronic access was repeatedly failing but seemingly no coherent approach was taken to remedy this. The back up master armoury key was kept in a PIN protected locked box, but the PIN number was universally known. Because of an error in the computerised system an officer was allocated single point access when she should not have been. She unwittingly let Sean, whose own access to the armoury had been restricted without his colleagues being informed, into the armoury.

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course ofthe investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.
Tn my opinion there isa risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the
CGreumstances fis my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are 2¢ fllows:
(Grief summary of matters of concern)

Between his arial in SACU at 18.37 on 10 July 2020 and his being ciscovered self
Suspended with a hgature at 17.45 on 11 July 2020 there, Michael was subject fo 2 3 man
unlock
‘On the morning of 11 July, a Saturday, there were 3 officers on duty on SACU. This did
permit his cll fo be unlocked for a meal to be delivered and for a cursory one and a half
minute conversation with 2 nurse that fll shor, on ner evidence, of an aetual medical
‘On the afternoon of 11 July there ware only one or (briefly) two officers on SACU duty per
the staff duty log, albek, a6 CCTV footage shows, more officrs did attend Intermittetly for
Specific tasks. The SACU staff duty log shows only one officer on duty forthe whole
‘afternoon to 17-00. In any event medical assessments of Michael were not undertaken at
‘ny stage while he was on SACU, the reason being given that he was on three man unlock.
Te appears that there were never sufficient staff avalable fora dedicated medical
‘assessment to be undertaken. This notwithstanding that evidence from prison officers and @
nurse was that during the course of the afternoon Michale's presentation hag become
Saran” and “bizare”. In fact, [eis now known, he had been ingesting toxic amounts

an unlicensed drug, ne had secreted into the prison (his beina detected at

Teception as plugged lad him to SACU), sa highly potent which
‘ffecs judgement and iowars inhibtions. Me jury subsequently condtuaea tat the
‘absence of medical, and mental heath, assessments, and the use ofthe IM (which
‘was never dagnosed), contributed tothe Michael's death

From 17.00, when patrol state commenced, there was clear only one officer on duty and
present. When she discovered Michael self suspended that officer made a perfectly
Sefensible dynamic assessment, electing not to enter the cll unsupported. She made ready
{enter for when back up arrived. In the event, parly because there was anather discipline
incident unfelding on a diferent wing, this took 2-3 minutes. There were only 16 prison
officers available while on patrol state acrass the entre pron, and they were already at
{ull streten, and probably beyond It (the Tactical Resources Unit rom Doncaster were en
route).

‘The evidence was that without knowing precisely when Michae!self-suspended any such
delay could not be held, on a balance of probabilities, to have entered the chain of
‘ausation death. However, the fact remains that there was a delay consequent to Michael
being ona three man unlock but there beng only a single oficer avaliable on SACU wile in
patrl state. Iris reasonable to conjecture that this could have made the alference
Between life and death in this case, and the repetition ofthese circumstances could well do
so in future

In your response dated 15 November 2021 te the Regulation 28 report of HM Assistant
Coroner James Thompsan of 21 September 2021 following the Inquest Into the death of
CCharle Brian Todd at HMP Durham, you wrote, amongst other things:

“There is clear management oversight of the SACU’

‘This isnot what the evidence in the instance case showed. Rather, what it made clear was
that

2) the SACU staff Ig plus CCTV further demonstrated that HMAC Thompson's point to you

Decent Tone Ups SOOT RET
{hat “officers, eluding OFICers Wt posted to SACU, but covering Tora shift, were required
to allocate various task between themselves on an adhoc basis"" was an ongoing problem,
{2d this appears to be stil ongoing

2) NOMIS record Keeping was unhelpfully sparse (""you would expact more"" was the
Guidence of SACU manager);

3) the dally log was uncer tlised as a mult-dsciplinary tool, and this appears to be
ongoing.

""You also stated

“Lam confident that the staffing levels and supervisory arrangements in place are sufficient
to deliver al ofthe SACU’ regime

‘This, to, is clearly not the case. Staffing levels remain the same. Safeguarding of prisoners
is compromised 22 a consequence. With a three man unlock imposed, there should be tree
officers avaiable at al times to ensure safety. Staffing levels at HMP Durham should be
increased,

1. On 13/07/22 Dr Ellson's GP needed to arrange an urgent mental health review as Dr Ellson

for GPs to contact mental health teams for urgent reviews is not clear nor safe.

2. Once contact had been made and a request was made for Dr Elson to be assessed by the

being made, and the burden should not be put on them to make the cal,

3. The GP caring for Dr Ellson on 13/07/22 was unaware that she could make a request for a

(On 24” May 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jade Hutchings aged 18.
‘The investigation concluded at the end ofthe Inquest on 28” September 2022. I concluded
lth 2 narrative conclusion of

Jade, who was vulnerable, had been strugaling with his mental heath. He had been using
Slcohel and drugs to mask underiying Issues and he had been finaing it aiicult to engage
‘wth services in order to adcress ths. There were missed opportunities by a number of
{ervices to proactively engage mith Jade to ensure that e was being encouraged to adéress
his dependency on aleohol and drugs and notably the missed apportunty to carry out a child
inneed review when Jade was approaching 18 which did not occur due to Ris case being
closed prematurely. Jade's death was contributed to by neglect.

| CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

In 2019 Jade's behaviour started to deteriorate. He dropped out of St Pauls’ College anc
Started to got involved in crminal acbvity. He came to the attention of Children Services, the
Mental Healt Service and the Police (having been the victim of assaults, being involved in
domestic cisputes and having been arrested for aggravated burglary).

‘Aleohol and substance misuse played a substantive part in his Ifestyle.

‘At 22:07 on 20 May 2020 Mrs Hutchings (Jade's mother) reported to the police that Jade
(ovho was 18 atthe time) had not returned home. She said that he had eft the house at
17:00 under the inuence of aleahol and drugs saying that he would be back soon. He didn't
retum so Ms Hutchings contacted his friends but they had not heard from him. She was

‘The Police treated Jade as a missing person and tried to lacate lade. At 03:00 police located
Jade at Hastings Town Centre. He was crunk. The Police did not detain him under Section
436 Mental Health Actas they did think it was neceseary.They transported him Back home
to Haywards Heath. On arriving home he went to bed. When Jade woke up the following
‘morning, he was argumentative with his mother. He eventualy calmed down and apologise.
[ter thst morning his mother ang sister left the house &9 99 to the shops, They arrives back
home at about 14:00 and went upstairs where they found Jade hanging

Hospital where despite treatment he cled on 23rd May 2020.

‘The Cause of death is recorded as: =

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the investigation, my inquires revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion
there ic a risk that future deaths could occur unlass action ls taken. In the Srcumatances fis
my statutory duty to report 0 you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are 2 fllows:

Inadequate Police training on Mental Health

During the course ofthe Inquest ofcers involved in dealing with Jade (and in
particular around the exercise of thelr Section 136 powers on 21/5/20) acknowledged
{hat they had received very Ile mental health training. Some officers could not
recall any addtional training provided since thei ial training when they fst joined
the fore,

Fe

‘The officers admitted that although they were aware ofthe Sussex Police mental
health guide they had not read it in full

‘The expert police witness, NNN, told the Inquest that in hs view the online
training provision that we Were fold as being roled out in Sussex was net sufficient.
None of the officers involved n this case had yet undertaken this online training

1 was his opinion that officers should be provided with the nationally recognised two
day training course written by the College of Policing, The course is avaiable fr all
Police forces to be rolled aut locally. This traning had not been adopted By Sussex
Poli,

‘There was also confusion amongst Officers (and a lack of clear understanding) around
the provision and se of service the Haven at Milview could provide

‘REBOOT - Lack of provision to far alder age group
‘There was clear evidence that Jade vas vulnerable and had become invalved in
violence and erime in 2039 (the year before his death). Tt was balleved by some that

Jade exploited by gangs running county line drug operations. A need for an early
intervention was ldentiied by his socal worker and a referral to Reboot was made.

‘The Inquest vas told that at the time REBOOT vras prioritising 12 - 14 years children
‘and as Jade was nearing 18 they were unable to work with him. This was a missed
‘Spportuniy for Jage to Be involved in a form of early Intervention before his Ife
Started unraveling and he became more heavily entrenched in the world of crime,

‘Decurare Tempe Ups’ STIZ021
Its understood that at the time of Jade's death the Police and Crime Commissioner
‘was responsible for the REBOOT scheme But at te time of writing tis report the

and Justice Act 2009,

3 | INVESTIGATION and INQUEST
‘On 28 November 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of
Sarah Margaret Clarke. On the 23% April 2021 1 concluded the

Investigation. The medical cause of death given was:

Ja, Suspension

I determined that Sarah Margaret Clarke died by suicide

4 | CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Sarah Margaret Clarke was a 23 year old final year Business Marketing
degree student at Surrey University (US). She had a history of mental
health concerns for which she had sought and had previously received
treatment.

On the 19 November 2019 at or around 0%:00hrs Sarah attended the
Centre of Wellbeing (CWB) at SU as she was depressed and finding life
difficult. She completed an electronic proforma and a care worker
(qualified social worker with mental health experience) from the CWB
contacted her by telephone at or around 11.00 am. Prior to the phone call
the care worker had reviewed her previous involvement with the CWB
including previous suicidal ideation and potential acts of suicide. The
conversation included the following information from Sarah:

1, She had 2 $136 MHA assessments in July and August 2019

2. She had been formally admitted under $2 MHA in July 2019

3, She had been under the MH team at home until self-discharge in
August 2019

4. She was formally diagnosed with bipolar disorder and/or
‘emotionally unstable personality disorder

‘After a few minutes on the phone Sarah became extremely distressed and
she abruptly hung up. After five minutes or so the care worker phoned
Sarah back. Sarah did not answer, and the care worker left a message
asking Sarah to ring back. The care worker made an appointment for Sarah
to see a counsellor 2 days hence, on the 21"" November 2019 and an
administrator sent Sarah a genericemail informing her of the appointment.
No further contact was made by CWB to Sarah.

(On the 21° November 2019 at or around 09:00hrs an administrator at the
CWB became aware of an email sent by Sarah at or around 05:45hes
indicating that she intended to end her life. The administrator passed the
email onto a mental health nurse who thought it may be a ‘cry for help
and looked at her notes before requesting security to attend her
accommodation at the University of Surrey (US). Sadly, Sarah was found,
deceased and recorded to have died by way of self-suspension in her
accommodation within the US campus at 10.1 hrs on 21* November 2019,

Sarah left a final note indicating her distress by what she perceived was,
the patronising attitude and behaviour of the care worker during the
phone call on 19% November 2019. At inquest, it was recognised that the
‘CWB administrator did not send Sarah a document requesting a personal
assessment of her mental health status to assist in triage of Sarah's mental
health. Furthermore, Sarah did not, as was expected, confirm she would
attend the appointment and the administrator did not thereafter contact
Sarah again to ensure she would be attending,

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

1

heard evidence students have a higher incidence of mental health
difficulties, self-harm and suicide exacerbated by multifactorial
issues such as being effectively itinerant with work and other social
pressures.

Sarah was known to have significant mental health difficulties
exacerbated by a recent bereavement and other personal difficulties.
On 19 November 2019 after Sarah hung up on the administrator
and was knowingly extremely distressed, CWB staff did not take
steps to reassure themselves that Sarah was safe from self-harm,

TThe organisation and systems at the CWB were insufficiently robust
to appropriately manage, treat and safeguard students known to
‘have mental health problems and be at high risk to themselves on a
background of a lack of national guidance of what are the basic
requirements for universities to provide such services.

National guidance issued in September 2018 to reduce the incidence
of suicide in the student population had not been implemented by
‘CWB at the time of Sarah's death.

There was no internal (by CWB) or external regulatory (by US)
‘oversight as to the service provision at CWB before Sarah’s death or
indeed after her death,

There was little communication of learning between and a lack of
involvement sought or offered by local NHS mental health services
to ensure the service provided by CWB was within an acceptable
standard.

There was no serious incident report completed by US as to the
|working practices of the CWB and no reflection has taken place and
zo steps have been taken to put into place by CWB to provide more
robust systems to confirm the safety of students such as Sarah,

[ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I
believe that the people listed in paragraph one have the power to take
such action,

You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of its date;

Evidence has been received that Philp Battle self-referred to the ambulance service stating
he had taken and overdose ang that he had tried to hang himeif. The then triage system
(medical priory alspatch) concentrated on questions relating to physical heath such as his
physiological function rather tan assessing the actual presenting ""aks from poor mental
health including sef-inficted fatal harm. Mr Batt lived in warden monitored sheltered
‘Secommodation and na ingury was mase about whether someone could be telephoned to

there was no call to Merseyside Police to see its Mental Health triage car was available to

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are 2¢ fllows:
(Grief summary of matters of concern)

During the course ofthe inquest, evidence was heard from a Detective Inspector with North
Yorkshire Police who is a Firearms Licensing Manager. The evidence was that, unlike
‘Sandard police prosecutions, prosecutions of individuals by other authorities do nat involve
‘automatic checks of the Police National Computer which would flag whether that individual
is licensed to possess a firearm. The appearance of such an alert allows the firearms
licensing authority to assess the inaivigusls continuing sultabiity to possess 2 firearm In
the context of the prosecution and its possible eutcomes,

In this instance, the deceased was being prosecuted for tax fraud by HMRC and was due to
make a court appearance on the day of his death. He left a note of intent, indieating that
the prosecution and Its likely outcome were central to his decision to end his Ife. Had it
been flagged that the deceased was facing such a prosecution, I was informed that It was

The mica case of death was

ta Hanging

@ CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Daniel was under the care of the IHBTT team of SWYPT at the time of his death. He
became known to them on 16.07.21 folowing an attempt to hang himself. He was seen
by at least 17 diferent team members in at least 37 contacts during the two months of his
‘care under the team.

Evidence as ven by I ne autor fhe Sefous nent rport
commissioned by the Trustthat Ms teams remit was to act as actsis management and
prevention team fo avoid people having tobe detained under section in hospital. It

Provides intensive 24/7 contact with people at risk. It was described as a consultant led
team,

‘5 CORONER'S CONCERNS:

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

oa

982

53

34

58

56

‘While acknowledging Daniet’s high level of contact with the IHBTT team, the
evidence was that no one was taking responsibly for his care in a key worker type
role. The large number of people seeing Daniel did not make deep professional
relationships with him which would allow his needs and risks to be addressed in a
person centred and properly risk sensitive way. The relationships with Daniel were
Superficial and this infected the risk assassment process. The large number of
‘mental health professionals in contact with Daniel inhibited him establishing deep
relationships of trust.

“The risk assessments themselves were therefore superficial, often relying
Luncrtcaly on self-reporting without meaningfully engaging in suicide risk
prevention. The inital risk assessment on first contact on 16.07.21 was flawed in
that, despite the presenting context being an attempt at suicide by hanging, the risk
assessment was low risk of suicide!

Daniel was a serving soldier and there was a failure to meaningfully communicate
and engage with his Regiment and the medical staff attached toi.

Communication with the family was superficial and the evidence was that their
perception was that they couldn’ fully share issues and concerns because of
perceived barriers in information sharing. This may not have been the team's
intention, but it was the reality felt bythe family. This inhibited their engagement with
‘the team in Daniel's best interests. The evidence of was that
engagement withthe family was important because they were the people who knew
Daniel best and who would be the fist to identiy any risks or concerns,

‘There was evidence that staff inthe team struggled with decision making around
information sharing. For example, on 15.09.21, the day before he died, Daniel's
‘itfriend called to share concerns about his wellbeing. The person taking the call
indicated that Danie's lack of knowledge of her referral placed the team in difficulty
in sharing the information. In the event, a practioner saw Daniel for a vist only a
‘ew minutes later and correctly identifed his need for an urgent psychiatric review.
Notwithstanding this, | considered that this was evidence of a failure to understand
the basics of risk-based information sharing

In summary, therefore, | considered that there was evidence that a failure to
address these issues could create a risk of further deaths:

+ Superficialty of risk assessments
+ Lack of a key worker approach

+ Lack of communication withthe armed forces, army inthis case
+ Superficiaity of communication withthe family

+ Anxiety about appropriate risk sharing

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion ation should be taken to prevent future deaths and | believe you (andlor your
‘organisation) have the power to take such action.

3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST
(On 24 June 2021 | commenced an investigation into the death of Harry Joseph
Pengelly Armstrong Evans. The investigation concluded at the end of the
Inquest on 31 October 2022.
The conclusion of the inquest was Suicide,
‘The four questions - who, when, where and how — were answered as follows
Harry Joseph Pengelly Armstrong Evans died on 24 June 2021 at

Trecorrell Mil Trebulett Launceston Cornwall by hanging
EN 0901781 ociground of an acute

‘mental health crisis

@_| GIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Harry was 21 years old at the date of his death, he lived in Cornwall with his,
parents and younger sister. He was a student at Exeter University, studying
Physies and Astrophysics. At the time of his death, he was in his third year of a 3
year degree course.

Information Casifeaton: PUBLIC

Harry had no relevant medical history. He had not consulted his GP about
‘mental health problems

Harry took exams in January 2021; his exam results can be characterized as a
disastrous failure. His results leading up to those exams indicated a high
performing student.

Harry subsequently chose to defer the re-takes of both his January and May
2021 exams to August 2021. A total of 6 exams. Our academic witnesses
Indicated this was a huge amount of work for a difficult subject.

Harry resided at university continuously from 29 December 2020 to May 2021,
during which time there was little or no contact with his parents and family

On two occasions during May 2021 Harry's mother,
contacted by phone and email the University welfare services, raising concerns
about Harr). NNN stated that Harry was not sharing
Information with the family. Due to a systems failure both of these
safeguarding alerts were closed off without further action,

In late May 2021 his parents visited Harry and were concerned at his physical
and_mental condition. They brought back Harry back to Cornwall.
REE 0"" ernailed Harry's tutor, raising further concerns about
Harry, and indicating that he was not sharing information with the family. These
concerns were forwarded to Welfare Services who indicated that no
Information could be shared with parents without the consent of the student,

(On 28 May Harry contacted his personal tutor and welfare services raising
concerns about his mental health and expressly referring to the difficulties he
hhad in communicating those concerns. He referred to the isolation that he had
suffered during the pandemic and the mounting academic pressures he faced in
undertaking the re-sits. These concerns were forwarded to Welfare Services
who sent a number of emails to Harry inviting him to fil out an online form to
access a telephone appointment.

There was no attempt to contact Harty by phone or in person by anyone at
Exeter University. There was no consideration given to sharing information with
Harry's parents without his consent. There was no attempt to speak to Harry to
obtain that consent.

Only after Harry’s death did his parents find out about the extent of Harry's
exam failures,

Information Casifeaton: PUBLIC

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to
concern. In my opinion there isa risk that future deaths will occur unless action
Is taken. In the circumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

1) Training

The evidence that indicated an absence of mandatory training for academic
staff on suicide prevention and mental health awareness.

‘The University is invited to review the provision of training for academic staff
‘upon information sharing {see below], mental health awareness and suicide
prevention

2) Responding proactively

‘The evidence indicated that nobody from the university attempted to speak
to or visit Harry despite numerous concerns being raised regarding his
wellbeing. There was a total absence of personal engagement.

‘The court heard that research has consistently shown that most students and
staff who experience poor mental health da not access formal support,

The university response was entirely by email and can be characterized as
reactive. The evidence indicated a marked reluctance to respond flexibly and
proactively to concerns.

‘The university is invited to review their policy as regards their response to
welfare concerns and whether the current approach is sufficiently flexible and
proactive. Specifically, whether there is an over-reliance on email responses
and students themselves completing online application forms to access
support.

3) Sharing information

The university policy allows sharing of information with consent in
circumstances involving a concern for wellbeing, and without consent in
exceptional circumstances. This necessarily would have involved a
conversation with Harry and failing that a consideration whether exceptional
circumstances applied for sharing information with his parents.

‘The evidence revealed a lack of staff awareness regarding university policy on
Information sharing. There was evidence of a misunderstanding of policy
which specifically allowed the sharing of information in cases of concern,
subject to discussion with Harry, and then in exceptional circumstances

Information Casifeaton: PUBLIC

without his consent. Witnesses referred to @ blanket ban on sharing or
alternatively to sharing only if they perceived imminent risk to life.

The evidence indicated that there was insufficient consideration given to
notifying Harry's parents of the extent of his exam failure, in order to fully
mobilize Harry's support network. There was no evidence of the Think
Family’ approach adopted by the university following previous suicides.

‘The University is invited to review the thresholds for sharing information and
staff awareness of those thresholds, and the implementation and
Understanding across academic and welfare staff of the Think Family
approach.

4) Pastoral support

The evidence indicated that if Harry’s pastoral tutor had known Harry's
mobile number, he may have called him. The court heard that there was no
policy for pastoral tutors exchanging mobile numbers with students.

The university Is invited to review whether pastoral tutors should offer to
exchange mobile numbers with their students, and to consider whether
pastoral tutors should have a work mobile to facilitate a proactive approach
Inthe event that there are concerns for wellbeing

5) Welfare services case management system
The court heard evidence that systems failures led to safeguarding alerts not
being followed up and the case marked closed.

The university is invited to review whether the welfare case management
system is it for purpose, whether iti sufficient to capture and ensure actions
(on welfare concerns raised by students or third parties.

(On 7 February 2018 an investigation into the death of Jessica Louise LAVERACK
“Jessie”, age 34 years, was commenced. The investigation concluded at the end
ff the inquest on 27"" June 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was:

The lack of an appropriate, co-ordinated approach to her issues, which was
further hampered by inadequate information sharing, while not directly
causative of her death, would have affected the state of her mental health and
contributed to her decline.

McD: 1a Hanging

Ihave attached a copy of my findings of fact, and reasonings regarding
conclusion.

| CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH
—

Jessie had a history of domestic abuse. She suffered from anxiety and had a
history of alcohol dependence which was a way she coped with emotional
distress.

Jessica reported domestic 2b1<¢, i

free
RR 205516 1125 advised to move home in order to
keep herself safe.

Her MARAC status was moved from Rotherham to Beverley.

After hearing the case in a hearing where she was allocated, as was the norm, a
‘maximum of 10 minutes her case was archived.

There followed a series of incidents whereby her ex partner was attempting to
obtain her address and was contacting her family. Between August and January
while interacting with a number of agencies including the police she disclosed
the fear that she was living in, she further reported on accasion suicidal ideation
and she attended A&E with cut wrists, However, it was noted that she was
‘motivated to get well. Her treatment focused on her alcohol use rather than an
holistic approach to someone with a dual diagnosis,

The matter was not referred back to MARAC as it was not deemed high risk
There was nota structured co-ordinated approach to her care, and there was a
lack of information sharing.

There was contact with Jessie and her ex partner leading up to her death,

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to
concern. In my opinion there isa risk that future deaths could occur unless
action is taken. Inthe circumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

(1) The is a need for the recognition of the link between domestic abuse
and suicide. Processes and policies do not seem to include this serious
area to the extent that is required,

(2) There is no system to appropriately identify and care for the vulnerable
who do not meet the criteria of “high risk” which is covered by MARAC,
evidence was heard that a large number of domestic homicide reviews
cover vitims who have not been rated as “high risk”

(3) There was a lack of information sharing between all agencies, even
those tasked with domestic abuse.

‘a. There is no one database which is accessible for all agencies to
Input their common concerns.

'. There is lack of robust policy of information sharing regarding
both suicidal ideation, self harm as well as identification of the
vulnerable.

It is noted that the Health and Care Act is due to commence on 1

July 2022, which outlines need for interagency working. This may be

an ideal opportunity to address these issues.

(2) There is no single point of contact to oversee the collation of all

information, to appropriate assess it and to coordinate a structured
proactive approach to people with dual or multi diagnosis. This is in
both MARAC and for those who are vulnerable but do not meet the
“high risk"" criteria,

(5) There is @ need to consider better training and awareness of both
domestic abuse and risk of suicide for front line police officers.

(6} Consideration to be given to whether the deployment of front line
officers to deal with domestic abuse is appropriate, and whether this
should be referred to police adult safeguarding in the same way that
criminal investigations are often elevated to CID.

(7) Evidence was heard that the DASH form may benefit from updating

(8) The processes of Humber police’s vulnerability hub and DARA forms
which show a more proactive, collative approach, are not currently a
nationally recognised method of working

(9) If not already in place, to consider complex case forums on a national
level.

(10)Consideration as to whether GP's and other voluntary

‘organisations/non-statutory organisations should be invited to MARAC

(11) To consider better information sharing about the risks of sleep

deprivation and its impact on mental health and suicide.

(12) | was requested to consider placing MARAC on a statutory footing in

‘These were recorded as

‘on the 20th October 2019, ohn Henry White suspended himself

Police werein attendance. John was eventually
‘eleased and transferred to the Royal Glamorgan Hospital where he died on 23rd October 2018,

‘The Inquest focused upon
[A How, and in what circumstances Mr White came about his death

8. The unavailability of issued equipment (primar ligature cutters) tothe response officers attending upon
[Mr White leading to an extended period of suspension by ligature,

‘The jury found that this omission to act to cut the ligature had possibly contributed to his death
‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

‘During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

In my opinion there isa risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN areas follows.

1 In June 2020 the independent Office for Police Complaints recommended that all response vehicles be
equipped with aigature cutter or similar.

‘That recommendation was accepted by Chief Superintendent Clare Evans on behalf of South Wales Police in
suly 2020,

{received evidence from Chief Inspector that n 2020 South Wales Police had determined to
wien the scope ofthe recommendation tal fontine officers. She informed me that ligature cutters were
elivered tothe force in uly 2022.

[As at the ath of October 2022, approximately 25% of those had been distributed to frontline officers

‘she was unable to assist the court with the timeline forthe remaining distribution other than in relation to
ner own force division -a target date ofthe 22nd of October 2022.

‘she candidly accepted in her evidence thatthe incomplete distribution toall frontline officers at this time
‘meant that the scenario faced by the response officers attending upon Mr White an the 20th of October
2019 was stil patent & the opportunity to release a suspended individual currently dependent upon
Wwhether there had been distribution tothe tasked response officers.

‘That s the concern that | have and wish you to consider and address

2. Acollateral concern, not directly causative of Mr White's death, rose during the inquest and which also
wish to bring to your attention,

‘This concerns the availabilty of bespoke training to response officers in relation to handling similar
‘situations faced by the officers on the 20th of October 2019.

Ihe thre attending officers on 2030.9 indicated that they had not received speci tralning
(otwthstanding the evidence received from retired Detective Chief inspector il that he had prepared
a video for officers covering this typeof scenario as part of mental health awareness taining in 2017 to
assist them in managing the scenario they faced

Rete Oetcive het spect ated tate had delivered rang that year ofcers win
{the force fr the purposes of cascading the same widely.

{Given both the statistical and anecdotally evidenced increase in mental health crisis incidents (on occasions
resulting in death) that your officers ae required to attend, I believe that it would be of benefit to those
loffcers who have nat received this bespoke training, as wel, perhaps those who may benefit from
‘refreshing their knowledge) for consideration to be given to reinstating the same and expediting its delivery
Widely i.e. to all frontine staf.

| would stress that the two immediate response officers cannot be, nor indeed were, criticised in their
individual interactions with Mr White on the 20th of October 2019. Indeed, and without the apparent
benefit ofthe traning, they interacted with Mr White in accordance withthe appraach advocated by retired
(Detective Chief inspector

During the Inquest evidence was heard that:

|. In the days leading up to Bradleigh’s death he barricaded himself
in his cell and force was used to remove him from the cell. PSO
1600 is @ HM Prison Service document which provides guidance
to Prison staff on the use of force. Whilst t can be accessed by
‘others outside the prison, there Is no national guidance from the
NHS to healthcare professionals about the use of force in prison.
Usa Turner, the Regional Healthcare Service Manager Practice
Plus Group (PPG) who currently provide the healthcare at HMP
YOI Portland, confirmed it would be of benefit to have such
rational guidance to assist the healthcare staff when force is
used in prison. Healthcare Input Is critical in the use of force due
to risks of positional asphyxia which could lead to a future death
as wall as the risk of injury.

il, At section 6 of PSO 1600 it details the ""Role of Healthcare in
planned and unplanned use of force” and at 6.11 states that
Procedures should be agreed at 2 local level. There is no local
operating policy between the prison and the healthcare at HMP
YOT Portland. Oxieas NHS Foundation Trust (Oxieas) are to take
over the contract for the healthcare at HMP YOI Portiand on the

3. | INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

COnthe 3 Apel 2019 an investigation commenced into the death of Daniel John.
O'Sullivan, born 11 Decomber 1979, who died on the 27 March 2019,

‘The investigation concluded atthe an ofthe inquast on 12 October 2022.

‘The medical cause of death was:
fa) Asphiyxia

1b) Hanging

Use of cocaine

‘The Conclusion ofthe Inquest is contained in the following extract from my narrative
conclusion

*.. Based on Dani's psychiatric medical records and evidence from an
Independent expert psychiatist there were flues inthe management of
Danio’ risk of selinficted death and inthe treatment of his delusional
sore.

‘The decision fo rescind his &.2 MHA detention on 25/9/19 was inadequate dus fo
failures to update a risk assesement for selinficted death by taking account of
his most recent threat of suicide on 133/19 and his recent articulation, during
adinisson fo Amazon ward

‘The decision to rescind s.2 was further undermined bya failure to formulate @
‘toatment Care Plan which should have sought fo treat his psychosis using
“antipsychotic medication and treatment of hs drug misuse through psychological
therapy. The decision fo rescind wae also undermined bya failure fo recognise
‘hat Daniel faked capacity through his inbily fo appreciate that his delusional
beliefs wore not grounded in reality.

Rescinding Danis detention under 8.2 MA was a missed opportunity fo
assertively treat his psychosis and drug use in hospital, The combined effect of
his psychotic canton with ile drugs bad diven Daniel's recent atfempts 10

From the evidence | received, at the inquest, thee are matters giving rise to concern
Inmy opinion thore isa risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In
the ercumstances its my statlory duty to repor to you!

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as folows. —

11) On completion ofthe inquest, | found the decision to rescind detention under
'5.20n 25/9/19 was undermined in two essential respects:

2) Afellure to update a suicide seitharm risk assessment

) A faue to formulate a Care and Treatment plan identiying core
treatment needs

“Serious Incident Investigation (SD, commissioned by CNWL, completed on
91872019, investigate the Risk Assessment eloment and made recommendations
hich I Reard from a CNIWL witness had subsequently been implemented and Iam
Salsfled that this risk oie has been satisfactory reduced.

However | remain concemed that the Care and Treatment plan aspect was not
identified by the Sil and ae such no recommendations were Identified an followed up,

‘The psychiatrist who rescinded s 2, on 25/9/2019, was unable to participate in the
Inquest though illness.

‘As a result, instructed an independant expert psychatist who gave evidence that
thre had Been no treatment plan addressing Dansel's core treatment needs.

‘The core treatment needs were that Danial raquired antipsychotic modication to
control his delusional beliefs and psychological intervention to address his substance
‘misuse which exacerbated his delusional bel

‘The exper also identifed fom statements and medical records that Daniel lacked
insight into his mental health conditons and thereby lacked capacity. The treatment
Danial required was twofold. Assertive reatmont ofthe delusional dsorder with
antipsychotics, whist detained under s.2, to achieve stabil, coupled with
psychological therapy to address the iit drug use.

heard evidence that antipsychotics could not commence until the results of ver
function tests were avalabl, but this id not persuade the exper, that recssion of $2
was correct

‘The psychiatrist who rescinded s.2 on 25/8/19 was interviewed by the Sil bu the care
‘and treatment plan aspect was not explored by that investigation,

My concem i that failures in the formulation of a Care and Treatment Pan made a
Significant contrbuton lo the death and this fang was not exposed unt the inquest
when i could have been identfiad much ear by the Silla September 2019,

‘The fact that @ Care and Treatment plan was nat formulated gives me concern that
the mistake could be repeated in flure and my eoncem is compounded by the SI
faling to investigate and make recommendations arising from this issue.

‘Accordingly, 1am reporting this matter to the Minister for Health and CNWWL Trust to
‘make such recommendations as they see iarising from the expert evidence
Uncovered by the inquest so that any necessary lessons can be learned.

2). My second concer s the poor contemporaneous documentation ofthe grant
cof unescored leave from the hospital and the ime taken to alert the poice
\when Danial faied to retum on 26/3/18 by 21:00 pm. A ward nurse eventually
Contacted the police after midnight

|) Lam concemed that an earlier cal tothe police may have prevented
the death, because Daniel was recorded on General Sacunly Zone
(GS2) cameras at 22:21 leaving Vauxhall bridge, and retuning, on
foot at 28:48. An eater cal might have enabled police to intervene
before he was able to commence the actions which ended his i

|) The ward manager claimed in evidence that he had instructed others
to call the police when Danial failed to return at 21:00. However, is
was nol documented anywhere inthe meical records and a leave
book with handwrien enviee want missing ater the death. The
missing leave book was not investigated bythe SIl

Ti) A-nurse who called te paleo, sometime before 00:30 according To
the medial records, or at 01:10 according to police records, was not
interviewed by the SI

ound these investigative deficits troubling because the learing of assons inpatient
care depends, in part, on an early SI by the hospital concemed so tha sks to patient
Safety can be identified to enable recommendations and improvements long belore an
inquest conclusion

‘The delay in reporting the failure o return to the Ward was a factor that contibuted to
the dangerous situation already created by rescinding 52.

11am nonetheless concerned that, in general, psychiatric patients being tested on
voluntary leave are a vulnerable group and as such fallures to retum should be
reported with expadtion not only Because thay may be a danger fo themselves, but
also due toa risk of being preyed upon by others.

2. The poor documentation and delay in alerting the police when Daniel failed to return from leave may have contributed to his death.

regulations 28 and 29.

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

On 3 May 2022, one of my assistant coroners, Sarah Bourke,
‘commenced an investigation into the death of Max Turbutt, aged 21
years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest earlier today.
Imade a determination of death by suicide, The medical cause of death
was hanging.

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Max had suffered mental ill health for a number of years. He had been
‘accommodated under Section 20 of the Children Act and supported by
Kent County Council as a Child in Care, then as a Care Leaver by the 18
Plus Service under Section 23c of the Children Act.

CORONER'S CONCERNS.

During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving
rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur
unless action is taken. In the circumstances, itis my statutory duty to
report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows,

May's father told me at inquest that in March and April 2022, Max tried
to contact his personal advisor at the 18+ Service at Thistley Hil in Dover
fon several occasions over a number of weeks, but found her phone
always to be switched off. There was no redirect and no out of office on
her email

Max's father also tried to call her, with the same result. Just over a week
after Max's death, his family received a letter addressed to him from Kent
Social Services, explaining that his social worker was off sick. A crisis
number was given and Mr Turbutt called it, but it was simply an
answerphone.

This arrangement does not seem adequate for a vulnerable person in
need.

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and |
believe that you have the power to take such action.

YOUR RESPONSE

You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date
of this report, namely by 19 December 2022. |, the coroner, may extend

‘The way that he platforms operated meant that Molly had access to images,
video clips and text concerning or concerned with self-harm, suicide or thal were
‘otherwise negative or depressing in nature

‘The platform operated in such a way using algorithms as to result in some
circumstances of binge periods of images, video clips and text some of which
were selected and provided without Molly requesting them,

‘These bingo periods, if involving this contontare likely to have had a negative
effect on Maly.

‘Some of tis content romantiised acs of sl harm by young people on
themselves,

other content sought to isolate and discourage discussion with those who may
have Been able to help.

Moly turned to celebrities for help not realising there was ile prospect ofa
reply

In some cases, the contont was particularly graphic, tending to portray selt-
harm and suicide as an inevlable consequence of a condition that could not be
recovered from,

‘The sites normalised her coniton focusing on aliited and rational vow
without any counterbalance of normality

‘The conclusion ofthe inquest was that

Suicide. Missed opportunities between the hours of 12.00am and 12.00 neon, an under

‘isk assessment process and ward layout,

“4 [CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

(On 3 April 2018 the Deceased (‘Katharine’) was transfered tothe Lakefield Ward at
Clatteroridge Hospital from Aintree Hospital, to which she had been admitted on 28 March
2018 after suffering multiple spinal fractures when she jumpad from height into the River
Hersey in an attempt to kil hevsef. She was 2 detained patient under Section 2 ofthe
Mental Hoaltm Act.

Katharine was well known to the clinical staff on the Lakefield Ward, having been admitted
‘as both a detained patient and on a voluntary basis on a number of previous occasions,
{ypealy following impulsive episodes of selt-harm or actions consistent with attempts £2
{ake ner own life It was known that these occurrences would often follow a tigger event,
notably including disagreements with her husband, Her diagnosis at the tme was
‘Smationally unstable personality disorder, for which she wae being treated appropriately, in
line with national guidance. Inthe past she had been diagnosed as suffering rom
schizophrenia, but this was dropped as a secondary diagnosis in 2016.

‘Gn6 April 2018 Katharine was moved from a room on the main comidor ofthe Lakefield
Ward to one tucked avay, further from ward staff

(On 11 Apr Katharine aeked for her level of observation to be reduced. They were, from 2
to Li. Later the same day she reported feeling emotional and increasingly impulsive

‘On 13 Apr 2018 she left he ward at 10:07 to mest her husband outside. They argued and
the meeting was cut short. He rang ward staf to inform them about what had happened
‘and that she was returning. Katharine arrved back at 10:25 and, prompted by the call, a
Clinical Support Worker visited Katherine's room and found her crying an wpaet. PRN
medication was offered and accepted; and glven at 10:40 by @ nurse. Katharine was then
Inf alone but shorty aftewards presced her alarm bell to request assatance with her back

‘The jury found that Katharine had committed sulcide, but concluded that missed

During the course ofthe investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern
In my opinion there sa risk tat future deaths could cecur unless acuon i taken. In the
CGreumstances fis my statutory duty to report to you

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are 2¢ fllows:
(bret summary of matters of cancer)

1. The ward layout didnot lend itself to easy observation of patents. The Court's
‘expert considerad iwholly inadequate’. The juny fel tat this contributed more than
minimally to Katharine’s death

‘A number of rooms (including Katharine’s room, 23) ware remote from the nursing station
‘and largely out of sight unless visite fora specific purpose. Whist lam aware that some
‘anges have been made since 2016, Iam concerned thatthe current layout continues to
place vulnerable patients, who might take ther own lives at risk

It ls appreciated thatthe Trust might nat be in 2 positon to create a ward which eliminates
all of the layout issues. However, mitigation measures might be appropriate IF the present
faclites are to be used on an ongoing basis nan unmodified form. Tam concerned thatthe
limitations presented by the current Iayaut may mean that staffing levels need to be
[bdjustad to allow for greater levels of Informal coeervation, oversight and monitoring

2. The argument with her husband was a trigger event for Katharine. She was seen
briefly by some ward staff between her etutn to the Ward at around 10:25 and 11:00, but
loft completely unattended between 1100-12:00, The jury fl that there was a missed
‘opportunity at ths time to afect the outcome and that the assessment ofthe risk that
Katharine posed to herself had been inadequate

‘The evidence indicated that ward staff (seemingly regardless of thei level of experience
‘and seniority) who attend a patient in a situation like this are lef to determine what (F
‘ny action to take based upon thelr clinical judgement. In particular, iis let to the
individual to dace whether escalation toa Zenior clinician waulé be appropriate and

Improvement, PO Box 16738, Redditch B97 9PT,

1 | CORONER
Ms Anna Loxton, HM Assistant Coroner for Surrey

2 | CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS
I make this report under paragraph 7(1) of Schedule 5 to The Coroners
and Justice Act 2009.

3. | INVESTIGATION and INQUEST
The inquest into the death of Sandra Kirk was opened on 5! November
2021. It was resumed on 5® September and concluded on 15"" September
2022 before a Jury.

The Jury found the medical cause of death to be:

la, Asphyxia due to ligature around her neck

The jury returned a narrative conclusion, recording that Sandra had no
mental health history until after she contracted Covid-19 in November
2020. Whilst she appeared to make a full physical recovery, she became
increasingly preoccupied by the delusional belief that she had sustained a
permanent degenerative brain disorder as a result of Covid, which was
progressive and terminal,

They recorded that as a result of this fixed belief, she attempted suicide
on 23% February 2021 with a carefully planned overdose and carbon
monoxide poisoning, leading to a diagnosis of psychotic depression and

inpatient care until 5* March 2021, with Community Health Recovery
Service follow up in the community

On 15* May 2021 she attempted to end her {if
EE <6 25 dotted 0
Cygnet Hospital Woking (“Cygnet”) under section 2 ofthe Mental Health
‘Act on 17 May 2021. Whilst on section 17 escorted leave on 9 june 2021,
she again attempted I resulting in her
being detained under section 3 of the Mental Health Act; her leave being

revoked; and observations increased to every 15 minutes before being,
retumed to general hourly observations.

Sandra disclosed that she was non-compliant with medication to a friend,
and this was reported to Cygnet staff on 27 July 2021 at an MDT
meeting. A search of her bedroom was undertaken later that afternoon,
following a similar disclosure via another patient that Sandra had
reported non-compliance. During this search no medication was found. A

Jwere found and removed from her
bedroom, in accordance with Cygnet's Restricted/Prohibited Items policy,
which identified such items as “not allowed because it would not be safe
for them to be used in this environment”. A Nurse who carried out the
search gave evidence that she had noted rs
HME curing the search, but these were not removed as Sandra was
‘not deemed to be a specific risk of ligature.

(On 30% July 2021 Sandra herself confirmed to a member of nursing staff
that she had been spitting out her lithium medication,

On the morning of 2! August 2021, Sandra’s 57"" birthday, she was
recorded as being in the bathroom at 7.02am observations with the
shower running. At 7.55am observation, she was found deceased on the

‘oth00 0°

The Jury recorded that “Sandra's high risk of suicide, in combination
with the risk posed by ligatures to both other service users and Sandra
herself, and the high percentage of in-hospital suicides which are
undertaken through ligature use, mean that itis probable that the failure
to remove the dress belt when it was brought in to Sandra on 6"" of June
contributed to her death. In addition, INN was not removed.
when it was brought in and that it remained in the room following the
search on 27% July 2021, the failure to remove it is also a probable
contribution to her death. The risk of ligatures in Sandra’s possession for
the above reasons therefore warranted its removal on both occasions”,

Whilst Sandra's Consultant Psychiatrist expressed surprise that Sandra
EEE 0S<ession, nursing staff gave evidence that they would

‘ot have expected this to be removed as Sandra was not assessed as being,
at risk of ligature, although at high risk of suicide, because she had no
specific history of ligature use, They referred to a balance between
assessing risk and maintaining patient dignity in considering whether to
remove items of patient clothing, and that many items can be used as a
ligature by the determined user.

4 | CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Sandra Kirk was found unresponsive on the floor of the ensuite bathroom,
of her bedroom at Cygnet Hospital at 7:55am on the morning of 2»!
August 2071 mes She could not be
resuscitated and was declared deceased by attending paramedics at
853am,

5 | CORONER'S CONCERNS
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are:

= The evidence in this inquest was that Cygnet’s Ligature Risk
Reduction Policy and the Ligature Audit Tool/Ligature Risk
Assessment are standard documents used by Mental Health
inpatient providers, including NHS Psychiatric Trusts.

- The Ligature Risk Reduction Policy quotes the CQC guidance of
2015, that “Three-quarters of people who kill themselves whilst on
a psychiatric ward do so by hanging oF strangulation”,

= Whilst these documents provide detailed guidance in respect of
minimising ligature anchor points, they do not give guidance as to
minimising potential ligatures themselves, which are defined as
“Any item which can be used to make a loop or noose with the
intention of limiting the supply of oxygen to an individual by
hanging or asphyxiation”,

- Rather than emphasising the very real risk that specific items of
othing, memes can pose to vulnerable
patients, the document places emphasis on avoiding ‘blanket
restrictions’ which does not assist in identifying where the real
risks lie

= Death by the use of a ligature is likely to occur within a few
minutes, whereas observations for a high-risk patient not assessed

‘as being in immediate crisis, will generally be carried out four
times in every hour, which therefore provides only a limited
degree of risk reduction. Consideration should be given as to
efficacy of such a policy and whether this can be improved by
recognising that some items of clothing will be more obvious
ligature risks and may need to be removed in all cases,

Consideration should be given to whether an
address the above concerns,

steps can be taken to

6 | ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN
In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and 1
believe that the people listed in paragraph one above have the power to
take such action.

5 | CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving ris to concern
In my opinion there i risk that future deaths wil occur unless action is taken In the
ércumstances its my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

1) During his intial healthcare screening appointment on the evening he arived
AIH Hewell (25.321 ) and his secondary healthcare screening appointment
the following day, Mr. McDonald denied any mental health issues, and denied
‘any curent thoughts of suicide or sell-harm, His community GP records were

Tequsled and were received by the prison on SO32T: these showed a
previous history of depression, and two previous drug overdoses, the most
Fecent of which had been only 7 months eater

2) Despite this history, no appointment was made with Me. MeDonald by the
healthcare or mental healtheare teams to follow this up wilh him, and discuss
is mental health in mare dept

3) nis evidence to the inquest, the curent Head of Healthcare atthe prison
conceded that it might have been appropriate for someone to have visited MI.
MeDonald, raised with him what the GP summary had shown, and asked him
ithe would ike any help, bul that he would nly have expacted any such fol
Up if here had been any current concerns about his mental health. He further
‘confirmed that there would have been no automatic follow-up about this, even
if staff believed that Mr. McDonald may have deliberately mist them about
his mental health History during his healthcare screening appointments;

4) In subsequent correspondence to my ole, the Head of Healthcare has
Suggested that it might be appropriate to delay a prisoner's secondary
healthcare screening appointment unt his GP records have been obtained and
scrutinised, so thal concems about any history st ou in those records can be
raised with the prisoner. That proposals due to be raised at te prison's next
Local Quality Assurance Mesting,

5) Lam concorned that there is currently no system in place at HMP Hewell to
fellow up with a prisoner any discrepancy between the mental health history
which he has disclosed on artval at the prison. and that revealed in his
‘community GP records. Experience suggests that @ prisoner with a recorded
history of mental health issues, particularly one which includes arecent episode
of attempted suicide or saltharm through overdose, may be at his most
vulnerable during his fist days and weeks at a prison, and having been
reluctant to disclose such issues for any number of reasons ( e.. fear,
‘embarrassment ),may be reassured be fldthathealthcar staff at the prison
fa'e aware of that Pistory and can provide confidential suppor. In my view,
without routine follow-up in such cases, there remains a significant risk that a
Prisoner's recent significant history of suicide or sell-harm may be overlooked,
In those important early days and weeks in prison, and that such prisoners wil
therefore be at an increased rsk of further episodes of alompted suicide during
that priog

Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners
(Investigations) Regulations 2013,

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST
(On 20 September 2020 | commenced an investigation into the death of
Robert Arthur Brown, 68. The investigation concluded at the end of the
inquest on 30 November 2021. The conclusion of the inquest was that Mr
Brown died from 1(a) Severe Head Injury (b) Fall 2. Self-harm, The

conclusion of the inquest was Suicide.

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH
Robert Arthur Brown had a history attempts to take his own life and of

suicidal ideation. He was under the treatment of mental health trust during
2020.

Mr Brown was assessed as being a high risk of suicide on 3 September
2020. He reluctantly agreed to an admission as a voluntary patient to

hospital. At this time, the family and Crisis Team could not keep Mr Brown
safe in the community. His wife was known to be his carer and had taken

responsibilty for Mr Brown's medication.

‘Mr Brown remained in hospital for four days. On the 4th day he indicated
he wished to be discharged. He indicated that he no longer had suicidal
thoughts and appeared to have made plans as to the changes that he was
going to make which differed from those previously. He was assessed by

the clinicians for discharge, and this was agreed.

Mr Brown's wife was not contacted and advised that he would be
discharged. Mrs Brown only became aware of this when Mr Brown was in
transit back to his home address. The evidence from the clinicians was that
Mr. Brown had capacity and did not want them to contact Mrs. Brown and
that he would make her aware of his discharge. The instruction by Mr
Brown not to inform Mrs Brown was not documented and the oral evidence
from KMPT witnesses was that they could not inform Mrs Brown as this
would be contrary to Mr Brown's wishes.

(On 9 September 2020, Mr Brown was found fatally injured at the cfs close
tohis home address.

‘A Root Cause Analysis Report (the Report’) prepared by KMPT and
evidence was heard at inquest as to the findings. The Report included
finding that the ward should have contacted Mrs Brown to contribute to the
discharge planning but did not do so. The Report recommended that where.
there had been carer breakdown then there should be discussion with that
carer on admission and discharge. At inquest a witness was called to
‘advise on the implementation of the Improvement Plan but was unable to
explain to the Court the meaning of “carer breakdown” and when the
actions would therefore be engaged. Subsequent documentation from
KMPT provided evidence of the liaison with carers but did not address the

identification of “carer breakdown"" and how this would be addressed on a

discharge where there was no CPA in place.

CORONER'S CONCERNS.

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise
to concer. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur

unless action is taken. In the circumstances itis my statutory duty to

report to you

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ~

4. The Report states that “Carer breakdown is likely to have
increased the risks of suicidality on discharge as this was not
addressed during the hospital admission nor on discharge’.
The evidence from the KMPT witness and subsequent
documentation does not address what is meant and
understood to be ‘carer breakdown"" and as such may not be
identified prior to discharge.

2. As there was no process in place to require contacting a carer
con discharge where there is no CPA in place a patient could be
discharged without notice to a carer and as such care that is

anticipated to be in place on discharge may not be available.

‘ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and |

believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action

Mr. Brown had a history of suicide attempts and suicidal ideation and was under the care of a mental health trust at the time of his death.

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

‘0n29"" September 2021, an inquest was opened into the death of Dr Lee Winslow, who died at his
home on 12 June 2021, aged 56 years. The investigation concluded at the end ofthe inquest which
""heard on 28” July 2022.

‘The inquest determined that Or Winslow died as a consequence I

toxicity. The conclusion ofthe inquest as to Or Winslow’s death was one of Suicide

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

De Winslow was found dead at his home on 12"" June 2021 having taken
with the intention of ending hs life. The inquest determined that, whist the
HHI 2 ¢ probabiy been taken from one ofthe hospitals where he worked, the I had
been taken from Manchester Royal Infirmary.

In August 2020, Dr Winslow had previously attempted to end his life by taking an overdose of

25 oN 5 ba neon et ver

{roma previous prescription, Dr Winsiow frely admitted having taken the remainder ofthese
medicines from Trust stocks

Following this overdose, Dr Winslow was absent from the Trust on sick-leave until 14**December
2020. After a period of supervised practice, Dr Winslow returned to unrestricted duties in the week
‘commencing 18” January.

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS
During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern In my opinion

‘there is risk that future deaths will accur unless action i taken. Inthe circumstances its my
statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN areas follows.

1 Following the admission by Dr Winslow in 2020 that he had taken medicines from the Trust
witha view to ending his lif, itis matter of concer thatthe case was not formally
referred tothe Police and the General Medical Council

Making such referals would have had the potential benefit of-

1) Providing the Trust with ready access to external advice as to the adequacy (or
otherwise) of steps taken to mitigate the future risk of staff members
misappropriating mecicines with a view to sel-harming; and

il) Offered access toa mechanism whereby objective analysis of Dr Winslow fitness to
practise as a Consultant Anaesthetst (both from a health and broader perspective)
could have taken place;

2. In December 2020, the Trust became aware that, whist on sick leave from the NHS, OF
‘Winslow had continued with his private practice notwithstanding an explicit instruction from
his manager to the effect that he should refrain from all work. It isa further matter of
concern that this development did not, of itself, cause the Trust to reconsider its position
‘and make the referrals set out above;

3. Inthe absence of any meaningful external review ofthe case 2s a whale itis @ particular
concern that most of the actions which fllowed the theft af medication by Or Winslow in
12020 appear to have been taken as a result of decisions made by members of the Trusts
radical hierarchy.

In view ofthe gravity ofthe issues raised by Or Winslow's misappropriation of drugs in 2020,
and the previous suicide of @ Consultant Anaesthetist employed bythe Trust involving
misuse of prescription medicines, itis a matter of cancern that a more multi-dsciplinary
approach was not taken, perhaps overseen by someone such as a non-executive director of
the organisation.

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

Im my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and | believe you and your
‘organisation have the power to take such action.

‘YOUR RESPONSE

You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date ofthis report, namely by

3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(On the 5"" August 2020, The Coroner opened an Inquest into the
death of Susan Mary Regan. The investigation concluded at the
fend of an inquest on the 27% April 2022. The conclusion of the
inquest was a narrative form of conclusion of suicide contributed
to by a failure by Mental Health Services to recognise her
deteriorating mental health and the increased risk she
presented and to take effective steps to reduce the risk.

‘The cause of death was 1a) Hanging
| CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

‘Susan Regan was a 61 year old lady who had no relevant past mental
health medical history. She was a long serving, well thought of, member
of staff at Marks and Spencer. Her husband IMI died in 2017 and this
did understandably affect her but save for some minor characteristic
anxiety she had no recorded mental health issues. Following furlough
from her role at Marks and Spencer, she began to deteriorate in terms of
her mental health and her general wellbeing. She became malnourished
and dehydrated combined with increasingly disturbed behaviour
consistent with anxiety, arguably displaying potential psychotic
tendencies and evidence of self-harm. This resulted in a consultation with
the G.P. on 12 June 2020, involvement of The Mental Health Access
‘Team on 5° June 2020, the appointment of The Home Based Treatment
‘Team followed by admission to Stepping Hill Hospital in respect of the
poor state of her mental and physical health, on 11"" June 2020, followed

by an assessment under the Mental Health Act on 14 June 2020,
resulting in admission to a Mental Health Ward under section 2 of The
Mental Health Act. Following improvement in her condition, the section
was rescinded on 23"" June 2020 and Mrs Regan was discharged home
with continuing support from The Home Based Treatment Team. There
were ongoing symptoms and matters reached a head on 23"" July 2020
when Mrs Regan was reported to be at the end of her drive, screaming

Advice was sought and a visit planned for 24% July 2020 at which Mrs
Regan was described as anxious, very agitated and rubbing her hands
and face. Throughout a series of assessments over the months Mrs
Regan would either deny suicidal ideation or avoiding answering the
questions. She was known to not want to be hospitalised but her sons.
remained concerned that she be kept safe. Crucially, they were not
consulted on this point 24"" July 2020 contrary to the specific instructions
of a Doctor when she was consulted on 24"" July 2020. There was a
failure to have a discussion with Mrs Regan's sons about their opinions,
(on hospitalisation and the risks of not doing so. There was a further
failure to record any reference to hospitalisation in their notes following
the visit on the morning of 24"" July 2020. Mrs Regan's dosage of
diazepam was doubled and there appeared to be some improvement in
her level of anxiety. A planned visit took place on the morning of 25"" July

2020. Later that afternoon Mrs Regan took her own life by
REE 2 2 ligature, around the neck, in

her home address.

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise
to concer. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur
Unless action is taken. In the circumstances itis my statutory duty to
report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

1) During the course of the Inquest evidence emerged that the
clinical guidance of a Doctor required the Home Treatment Team
to speak to Ms Regan's sons to explore whether they feel she
needed to be admitted on an inpatient psychiatric unit. Admission
to also be considered if Ms Regan would continue to show non-
compliance on her medications. Such an enquiry was not
undertaken,

2) Itwas also confirmed in evidence that there was a failure to
property record a plan and properly communicate such a plan
with Mrs Regan's sons,

‘ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

believe you have the power to take such action

and appropriate plans not drawn up by the Home Treatment Team,

Groumstances feis my statutory duty to report to you

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are 2 fllows:
(Grief summary of matters of concern}

Robyn was failed by the Mental Heath Services quite frankly due tothe current lack of
resourcing and provisian in place to support young people struggling with their mental heath
Due tothe lack of availabilty of a Chia Psychiatrist there are long walting times for children
to be assessed. Robyn was hat Seen by a Child Psychiatrist and/or Psychologist, despite
there being a need for this to happen, thereby enabling her to be claghosed and receive a
‘treatment plan. Robyn's parents did everything they could during this perio to support
Robyn, including paying for a private counselor, but sadly Robyn's mental health continued
te deteriorate during this time, and she took he own if Robyn inal acceptance into ter 2
(Children ana Mental Health Services (CAMHS) silly di not happen i a timely manner.

‘Decurare Tempe Ups’ STIZ021
T do appreciate tat the landscape thatthe ocal mental Reath Trust (Sussex Parnership
Foundation Trust) was working under andthe fact that Covi heightened te level of
‘complexity acrose many services but there were many faligs inthe care provided to Robyn,

Tt became very clear during the Inquest that there is significant under funding ofthe local
‘mental health Trust who like many mental health Trusts have seen an explosion of referrals
{fo their Chidren and Mental Health services (CAMHS)

By way of an example:~

Referrals to West Sussex CAMHS have increased by 95.6% from May 2019 (389) to May
2022 (761)

Wast Sussex CAMHS caseload has increased by 85% from May 2019 (2239) to May 2022
canary

West Sussex CAMHS Duty caseload has increased by 112% from May 2021 (492) ta May
2022 (1498)

Mental Health ARE presentations, in period Apri 2021 - March 2022, have increased by 403%
‘on previous year (April 2020 - March 2021),

[Adaitionally, across Sussex CAMHS, as a whole, the ceferals data shows:=

ay 2022 was the highest numberof referrals the service has ever received (1350).
Of those 1350 referrals, 80% (1,081) ware accepted into the servic.

In comparison, In May 2019, 579 were accepted (65% accepted)

So, an additional 502 young people have been accepted in May 2022 compared to
May 2019,

Despite the increase in numbers accessing CAMHS there has nat been any relative increase in
resources fo mest this demand and therefore the current postion ls ls unsustainable ar I ls

National Police Coordination Centre, 2"" Floor, 10 Victoria Street,

London SW1H ONN

1 | CORONER
Ms Anna Loxton, HM Assistant Coroner for Surrey

2 | CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS
I make this report under paragraph 7(1) of Schedule 5 to The Coroners
and Justice Act 2009.

3. | INVESTIGATION and INQUEST
The inquest into the death of Christopher Dominic Boughton was
‘opened on 16 December 2021. It was resumed and evidence was heard
on and 8 July 2022, when it was concluded,

| found the medical cause of death to be:

1a, Suspension

I determined that Mr Boughton took his own life by hanging in a wooded
location in Oxshott, Surrey, at some point between being dropped off in
the vicinity by a taxi on the morning of 3 November 2021 and when he
was found deceased by friends searching for him on the morning of 5""
November 2021. He was reported missing to Police by his Partner and
subsequently by his Father just after midnight on 4 November 2021. He
was found by friends searching known areas that he liked to visit in the
vicinity of where his mobile phone indicated he was located.

4 | CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

(On the moming of 3¥ November 2021, Mr Boughton left his home in Lambeth,
seemingly to attend his office in London for work, He had told his partner the
previous day that he felt he was having a breakdown and that he had no way
Dt of ths situation. He did not arrive at work and was reported missing by his
Partner and then his Father just after midnight on 4% November 2021. The
investigation was assigned to the Metropolitan Police Service (""MPS"").

On the evening of 4% November 2021, phone cell site data showed Mr
Boughton’s mobile phone to be in the Leatherhead area. An email was sent by
MPS to Surrey Police (""SP"") using non-urgent email addresses, attaching a map
showing an area measuring 3,126 metres in Leatherhead, Surrey, and MPS
tasked SP to “send a unit to search the area”. SP deployed a unit to check car
parks and train stations in the area but without success,

‘At 0452am, MPS were able to ascertain from financial enquiries into Me
Boughton's accounts and resulting enquiries with Uber that Mr Boughton had
been dropped off by taxi at Fairoak Lane at the Junction with The Avenue in
COxshott on the morning of 3° November 2021. Again, this information was sent
by MPS to SP via non-urgent email addresses, but was responded to within 10,
minutes, with SP iCAD being re-opened and updated at 5.06am with the
location where Mr Boughton had been dropped off and a request to check this
MPS indicated they considered the investigation should now be transferred to
SP, but SP awaited the written transfer form from MPS. Family and friends of
Mr Boughton organised a search of the area, with knowledge of his known
favourite locations, and he was found, obviously deceased, at 8am, prior to SP
undertaking a further search,

5 | CORONER'S CONCERNS

The evidence of Detective Inspector ET, Tactical and
Policy Lead for MPS, highlighted a concern that in tasking and
transferring investigations between bordering Police forces, there is a lack
of ownership and discussion between officers at Inspector level or above
between forces, which would ensure effective tasking and, when
necessary, smooth transfer of investigations. Requests were made by
email and CAD, without discussions between officers.

This was confirmed in the evidence of Detective Chief Constable gam
HMM! SP, who stated that from her perspective there was a lack of
feedback from SP to manage MPS’ expectations regarding a search for Mr
Boughton.

In respect of the initial search, this meant that SP did not advise MPS that
they considered the search request unfeasible given the extent of land
outlined and the limitations on searching wooded areas during winter
night hours.

In respect of the request for a further search with more precise location
detailed provided, MPS did not disclose all of the information available

2

regarding Family and friends potentially being able to assist in finding,
the location based upon where Mr Boughton used to visit. There was no
feedback from SP regarding when a search might take place, leading MPS
to consider deploying its own search team,

Whilst contact telephone numbers for Officers at MPS and SP were
provided on the CAD, there is no evidence that direct contact was made
between the forces to discuss the investigation and how best to move this,
forward. A SP officer recorded on the CAD that until the transfer
document was received from MPS, SP were unable to arrange a search or
contact the specialist search team.

Whilst DI MM gave evidence that he is aware the NPC is
reviewing issuing guidance around tasking and transfers between
bordering Police forces, at present there appears to be no requirement for
appropriate Police Officers to make telephone contact between forces to
ensure effective tasking and transferring, in addition to the required
written requests, This means an opportunity to discuss and pass on all,
relevant information between forces may be lost.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are:

1. The lack of any detailed requirement for telephone discussion
between appropriate police officers on sending through written
tasking requests and considering transfers of investigation means
that an opportunity to discuss and ensure smooth transition and
passing on of relevant information is lost. This may cause delay in
effective action being taken by the tasked Force, ot (in the case of
transfers) by the Force to whom it is considered a transfer will be
made,

Consideration should be given to whether any steps can be taken to
address the above concerns.

6 | ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN
In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I
believe that the people listed in paragraph one above have the power to
take such action.

7 | YOUR RESPONSE
You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of its date; 1
‘may extend that period on request.

‘Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be
taken, setting out the timetable for such action. Otherwise you must
explain why no action is proposed,

CORONER'S CONCERNS
During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concer.
In my opinion there isa risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.

In the circumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ~

1.Evidence was heard regarding the manner in which information crucial to the
formulation of risk assessments was recorded and shared:

‘a)Two types of risk assessments were completed, with no system to ensure that important
information is present on both;

b) The previous incident in which Archi had attempted to take his own life in very similar
circumstances on the ward was not clearly entered on the risk assessments used by staff
and therefore not known to a number of those responsible for his care;

©) Those responsible for his care accepted that the above incident was one of which they
‘would have wanted to have knowledge;

d) The absence of that information may have affected the subsequent decisions made
regarding the setting of risk level, observation level and removal of potentially
dangerous ligature items.

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and | believe that your organisation
has the power to take such action.

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In
my opision there isa sk that future deaths wil occur unless action is taken. Inthe
‘roumstances iis my statutory duly to report to you

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are 2s follows. —

Matter One

‘The inquest heard that the Priory had identified thatthe garden fence was a risk. in
paricular the section over the door in about December 2018, There had been a number
Of escapes both over the fence and through i. in the months leading up to James!
‘escape. The number of escapes indicales that Garden area was not safe. There was
plan fo replace it but there were other prores.

More strking was that there is no national guidance for porimeter fencing and security
{or the outside areas of mental heal ‘ocked wards unica that in existance for mental

health secure units In particular, the height ofthe fence.

While itis accepted that national guidance ought not be necessary to carry out
‘appropriate isk assessments and eneure securelsafe spaces it i clear that such
‘Guidance is necessary to ensure the correct level of secur for vulnerable patients,
‘whist benefiting from the therapeutic sting of an outdoor space.

Matter Two

‘The evidence showed that there was no appreciation of the emerging pattern of
behaviour. A major contributing factor was the lack of exchange and tansfer of
information at the handover Between the consecutive shits. In particular, the form
specifically designed for this with a section for completion — incidents in last 7 daye
‘which would have provided an information flow through was aot completed.

Whilst | heard evidence of stops taken to improve information exchange at a higher love
than between ward staf (nurses and HCAS) Iwas very suprised to hear that no audit of
these ‘handover dacuments’ ad boen carried out. Givan the fundamental importance of
the exchange of information betwen each shift and consecutive shits Iam of the
‘pinion that The Priory have nol carried out sufcienty robust review. Unt this faire
is addressed there isa significant risk ofa breakdown in the communication of adverse
‘events across the shift pattern of several days. The risk of @ lack of appreciation of an
‘emerging patter of behaviour remains.

CORONER'S CONCERNS.

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In
‘my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the
circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ~

(1) | was told that the Crisis Recovery and Home Treatment Team (""CRHT"") use the
Care Partner records, a whiteboard and a manual diary to enter the various information
and action points and that its at the Multdisciplinary Team meetings that the actions or
steps are discussed and progressed. They are either crossed out, if completed, or
‘moved to the next date until they have been actioned. It was highlighted that in this
particular case two actions were not completed either prior to Kieran's discharge from
the CRHT or shortly thereafter. In one of these, the entry had been crossed out, giving
the impression that the matter had, in fact been dealt with when it had not. This indicated
that there was an issue as to the monitoring and execution of such actions or steps.

‘This anomaly whereby a significant step may have been overlooked remains a concern,

(2) The evidence | heard from one witness described how she was asked to contact
Kieran by telephone and to advise him of the fact that a Multi-agency Referral Form
(/MARF"") was to be submitted. | considered this was an inappropriate means of
communicating a significant procedure and which could potentially bear on his (or any
other vulnerable person's) state of mind

What was unclear is how the provision of this information and step to be taken will be
approached in future

(3) | expressed concern that someone having been discharged from the CRHT, there
appeared to be no route back into the Mental Health Service short ofa re-eferral to the
CCRHT itself via A & E for someone who remains vulnerable by reason of their mental
state and who is receiving therapy as part ofthe discharge plan. This isin the context of
someone who was receiving support from the Integrated Psychology Therapy Service
CIPTS"") and the Dyfed Drug and Alcohol Service (‘DDAS""), both of whom were engaged
in providing appropriate therapies.

My concern is that there appears to be an issue in relation to lines of communication and
information sharing between Primary Mental Health Services and Tier 2 providers of
therapy.

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and | believe you Hywel
Dda University Health Board have the power to take such action,

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are 2¢ fllows:
(Grief summary of matters of concern)

1 Mr Mebellan was dlagnosed aver 2016/16 as being autistic wth a designation of
Asperger's Synarome. He was alsa dagnosed as experiencing Bipolar Disorder, an
‘trrbution he aid nat accept which he repeatedly asserted to both previous Mental Health
{are providers and the subsequent Trust cnicians tasked with supporting him atthe time
(ofthis death, Tees Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust (""TEWV"").

2. He ineistd his dificulties were inked to his autism and not mental disorder. It was
[Secopted that he experienced autism and that was part of Fs inivicualty and that
in addition he may have hag a mental health disorder. It was accepted that his
{are and trestment cannot unbundle the {wo But he should be treated holistically.

3 Assessment and formulation of risks and safety summary did not fully explore the
impact of his autism. There was ite to suggest that TEWV staff a) considered the
higher prevalence of suiige for individuals wth a diagnosis of autiem and 5) that

OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE aerate Upind SOOT SEE
Tir NeLallan may Rave communicated his distress'and re information aferenty
to an Individual without a diagnosis of autism during his periods of cists or
increased risk and c) mage sufficient reasonable adjustments in relation to the
impact of his autism.

4 tthe time of his death, TEWV had progressed from alow baseline in the Trust's
\work in Narth Yorkshire to address perceived underdevelopment in thlr services
forthe autistic patient when presenting with a mental heath disorder. Ithag
‘expanded the use of a specialist team (Autism Project Team- APT"") to extend Its
‘work into North Yorkshire caseload. The steps taken were Incremental and not all
‘Staff understood that Team and access to that important resource. It is recognised
‘that improvements would take time and be resource depenent as well hwever

5 APT has three specialist and autem dedicated practitioners working exclusively with
‘autism across the whole Trust n both its regions of commissioned care although
{here are also non-decieated clinicians witn ome expertise of autism within TEWY.
‘TEI does not traat autiem in North Yorkshire.

6 TEWY ints recent audit indicates about 17% ofthe individuals open to TEWV (aver
120,000 in number) have an autiem marker ie have an ICD-10 diagnosis af autism
or experience suspected/eanfirmad autsm or have a referral including being
Suspected as aust

7 There was no direct causation tothe suicide found that directly attributed the acts
he took to his autism from the evidence. However Mr McLelian’scatress and
stressors before his death included his feelings that he was not gating what he saw
fo-be te nght help and that he would aot lose his feelings ef helplessness such that
he took his own ite

‘The concern is that the vary signifcant number of those open to TEWV with an autism
marker has increased and will cantinus to do so and thatthe higher prevalence of sulcide
‘within that expanding group will lead to higher sk of, and numbers of, autistic individuals
‘dying because of sulege both within TEWV locality But also nationally

Urgent solutions are required to prevent further deaths of autistic individuals especially
‘those with mental health aisorder by rapidly improving and expanding provisions for
‘assessment and management of risk of harm ta themselves for individuals within the
{utism spectrum while presenting with a mental heath disorder.

‘and regulations 28 and 20 ofthe Coroners (investigations) Regulations 2013,

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(024 August 2020 | commenced an investigation into the death of Dominic Robert
Noble, aged 32. The investigation concluded atthe end ofthe Inquest on 30 June 2022.
The conclusion ofthe inquest was a narrative conclusion based upon the cause of death
of fa Hanging, The narrative conclusion was that Mr Noble died as @ result of suicide
‘and made findings in relation to his management and the healthcare provided to him
‘hist he was on remand in prison.

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH —

Me Noble was remanded to HMP Leeds on & June 2020 on terorist charges. Inthe 10
‘weeks he was in prison he was seen on multiple occasions by the nursing staff. A
‘decision was made on 14 July 2020 that he should be assessed by a psychiatrist but he
emained on the wating lst without an appointment date atthe time of his death on
Saturday 16 August 2020,

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course ofthe Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concen. In
my option there is @ rik that future deaths will ccur unless action is taken. In the
Crcumstances Is my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as flows, —

(1) Evidence was taken athe inquest that:

(0) HMP Leeds has only 3 days por week ofa psychiatrist

(]) HIP Leeds has some 5000 prisoners arriving each year

(i) A arge proportion of the prisoners arriving have mental health issues

(iv) The mental health team is mainly @ nurseed service

(¥) The division of labour between mental health nurses and psychiatrists is that a
doctor is responsible forthe agnosis of mental iness, prescrbing medication
‘such as anti-psychotic drugs and seeing prisoners/patients with severe or
Complex conditions. Mental heath nurses make inllal assessments and provide
‘ongoing care.

(i) Concern was expressed about the adequacy ofthe psychiatric doctor provision
to provide psychiatric weatment for a large population which includes men with |
significant mental healt issues,

(i) Me Noble was deemed o require assessment by a psychiatrist on 14 July 2020
‘non-urgent case but at the ime of his death on 15 August 2020 no
‘appointment had been given,

time avaiable

‘Wil A mortal health nurse working on Behalf of PPG on 10 July 2020 Weniified the
“possiblity of emerging psychotic features"" and noted the sentient that
‘engaging in treatment as soon as possible militate in favour ofa better
‘outcome. Where such a suspicion was raised it would have been advantageous
to obtain a second opirion from a psychiatrist swity (particularly ater his
‘mother contacted the prison to repor his paranoid and bizarre conversation
regarding a gun a secret room in the prison and some unknown person trying to
alien.)

(2) itis acknowledged that evidence was given atthe inquest that
() PPG could draw addtional psychiatric input from elsewhere in the PPG
‘group, bu there was no evidence to indicate when, if ever, his was last done,
(jy Waiting umes for an appointment witha psychiatrist inthe community could
'be 5 months or more and thus the principle of equivalence of care was.
‘achieved

(@) Concern was expressed in the course ofthe inquest that the meagre provision of
peychiaric consultant avaiablity might deter mental heath nurses from making
feferrals. This concern was not accopted on behalf of PPG. Despite tis the
‘concer remains that a selling prophecy has inadvertent been created in
‘which referrals are not made because there is no resource to respond to any which
may be made

(4) The concerns raised mitrored issues raised in an inquest which concluded on 1 June
12022 relating tothe death of Mohammed Irfan Afzal in HM Prison Loeds on
“4 August 2019. In a narrative conclusion the jury concluded that despte an urgent
‘referral toa paychiarit on 15 July 2019, no appointment had been provided before
his death on 4 August 2019, ""iis possible thatthe delays in providing treatment
Contributed more than minimally to Mr Atzas deat

(6) In view ofthese concerns PPG are asked to review the availabilty of paychiatits at
HMP Leeds to determine whether t's sufcient to meet the needs of @ cohort of
mentally unwell prisoners

regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013.

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

On the 17 January 2019 | commenced an investigation into the death of Shona Christine
Michaela Campbell The investigation concluded on the 17 June 2022.

The Conclusion of the inquest was: ACCIDENT as part of a narrative Conclusion

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

‘Shona had suffered psychological trauma as a child and had been treated by mental health
services sinca the age of about 8. By the age of 18 Shona had an established diagnosis of a
severe emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD) together with emotional
dysregulation and was at high risk of impulsive behaviour that could lead to serious injury or
death. She had a long history of self-harming but cutting herself with sharp objects and had
‘multiple scars on her body.

‘Shona was transferred to Tesito House psychiatric unit (""Tesit"") from an acute psychiatric
Unit on the 22” January 2078. Tesito was operated by Alternative Futures Group (""AFG""),
This is a not-for-profit Charitable organisation that operates several psychiatric units. Tesito
was a 24 bed unit in Ardwick , Manchester to treat and support women with complex needs
which opened in 2017 but only cared for 8 patients. Services were provided in partnership
with Greater Manchester Mental Health Trust (‘GMMH"")

‘Shona was a patient of GMMH and was detained under section 3 ofthe Mental Health Act
This meant she was suffering from a mental disorder of a nature or degree which made it
appropriate for her to be detained in hospital in the interests oftheir own health and safety or
the protection of others and that there was appropriate treatment avaiable to her which
could not be given unless she was detained in hospital. That remained her legal status. Her
Responsible Clinician (""RC"") was a GMMH Consultant Psychiatrist assisted by a locum
Junior Psychiatric doctor who worked on weekdays. Multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings
‘and ward rounds occurred frequently but sometimes were not attended by her named nurse
and nor were the records of these kept appropriately updated andior reviewed.

[At Tesito she was treated with antipsychotic medication, mood stabiliser drugs and
antidepressants together with psychological therapies. Shona said that she heard voloes of a
persecutory and a derogatoryinegative nature as well as having visual hallucinations. These
were not assessed to be genuine psychotic symptoms but represented intrusive thoughts
when she became distressed. However, even if they were not psychotic related auditory
hallucinations, she could stil act upon them.

vist. Her mood and condition was very vanaie ane she could change from being happy and
stable to becoming distressed and seltharming extremely uichy. Sometimes she said that
ins arose out of fustration and that at othe mes because she wanted to kil hese.

The last formal risk written management plan was prepared on 16 October 2018 but was not
regularly updated prior to her death. Her overall management was dealt with at MDTiWward
rounds. After a petiod of Christmas home leave on 25 December 2018 she returned to the
ward intoxicated and expressing suicidal ideas|

MENEENENE 7210 Were seven further Incidents of her using Igatures
between the 28th and 31st of December and ligature cutters had to be used to remove them,
(On the 31 December she described hearing voices telling her to end her own ife. There
were further incidents of headbanging and on the 1 January 2019 during another incident of
head banging she threatened to hit a member of staff who had attempted to remove items
from her room in order to ensure her safety given the risk of self-harm.

‘Shona's abilty to repeatedly access forms of ligature was said to be a matter of concern but,
there was no clinical management plan formulated to address the risk that this posed and
investigate how this was occurring,

———
MNNNNNNNN *1)2 W228 obviously cyanotic and suffering from asphyxia, Ligalure cutters
were used to remave the ligature. On the morning of 8 January, she was found to have
ligatured again and resisted staff who try to remove it. She igatured it again within an hour
and then once more in the afternoon. At the MDTiward round on 9 January her condition
‘was noted to have improved and for the next couple of days she was stable but was stl
regarded as being at high risk of self-harm or suicide and was on 15-minute observations.
The nursing staff had the discretion in the exercise oftheir clinical judgment to take such
action as they thought were appropriate to protect her fe.

During the early evening of 11 January, she was noted to be in happy and stable mood. At
about 03:15 hours on 12 January she was found inthe bathroom of her room witha ligature
RS. 7°'s ¥22s comov0d by the use of ligature cutters,
although Shona resisted attempts to do this. She dectined PRN medication and was
preoccupied by using her phone but did not appear to be distressed. The nurse in charge
{decided not to put her on one-to-one constant observations but on random nature for shorter
periods of time. She also decided not to search her room. Although the nurse in charge had
last worked shortly before Christmas, she was aware of Shona’s general history of sel-
harming behaviour and that she had also read and was aware of the records relating to the
incidents that happened at the end of December 2018 and also on the 1, 7 and 8 of January
2019. She was also aware that the use of ligatures by Shona could be fatal

{At about 04:23 hours she was found in her room just inside the door ina state of cardiac
arest wih another (2.

Brought io er foom it was not used but kwas not explained why. About 10 minutes later
plaramedies arrived and ook over the resuscitation, There was a elum of spontaneous
Erculation, but it was not necessary for them to use thir defibrilatr.

‘Sho was taken to the Manchester Royal infrmary where despite treatment her condition
doteriorated, and she died on 14 February. She died as a consequence of asphyxiation due
to ligature strangulation

After Shona was found ina state of cardiac arrest on 12 January some staff made
retrospective clinical records which began at 05:35 hours. A support worker recorded that
another support worker had been told by Shona that she was planning to ligature during the
right but no contemporaneous cinical records were made of this. Neither of them could
specifically recall teling the nurse in charge. The nurse in charge countersigned this record
and agreed that she must have read the clinical note. Further clinical records were made
and timed at 06:00 hours by the nurse in charge and she made no reference to this issue.
‘She subsequently made her manuscript statement and a police statement but did not make
any reference about the support worker recording that Shona had told them that she was
planning to ligature and that she was unaware of this. No record was made after Shona was
found to have used to ligature at about 03.15 hours or that the nurse in charge asked her
whether or not she had another ligature and Shona had denied doing so.

AAthough there were meant to be four observations an hour performed there were missing
‘observations and, on some occasions, other members of staff were asked to do the
‘observations but that was nat recorded. The nurse in charge was unaware of this.
Consequently the records were not complete or accurate. It was also established that the
women on the unit would swap or acquire objects to harm themselves including ligatures
and this was known by the staff

‘A company called ""Safety Matters"" was commissioned by AFG to undertake a serious
incident investigation and produce a report examining the circumstances surrounding her
care and treatment as well as the appropriateness of the service provided. In addition to
identity any root causes or contributory factors and make recommendations to reduce the
liketinood of re-occurrence. The author said inthe report that he had undertaken many
reviews of services, staffing models, suicides and homicides including root cause analysis.

(One of the authors agreed that it was not a full and thorough report because there were
other documents and information, he would have liked to obtain but did not or didnot think
they were relevant. He was unaware that any members of staff had made manuscript
witness statements shorty aftr the events. Nor did he ask for any staff member to prepare a
statement during the course of his investigation. Although he was aware that there was a
police as well as a coronial investigation he did not thin it relevant to ask whether or not any
‘evidence or witness statements could be disclosed to him. The report did not consider
whether the observation records ware accurate and if not why or how they ware undertaken
in practice, The investigation was concluded without knowing the pathological medical cause
(of death, but on the basis that Shona had died as a result ofthe use of ligature.

The clinical and other staff involved were interviewed and written records of those interviews
were kept but there was not a consistent method of ensuring that these interviewed agreed
with the records or wished to amend and correct tham. However, important issues were not
investigated. The support workers were not asked about what was or what was not recorded
in the clinical notes concerning Shona saying she was planning to ligature and whether or
rot they told anyone else and if so who and when and why no clinical records ware made of
it The nurse in charge was not asked whether or not she was aware ofthis and, if'so, what
she did about it or her clinical rationale for her decisions. Nor was she asked why she had
‘not made any reference to it in her own retrospective clinical records if she was unaware of
this important clinical information, The nurse was recorded as saying that ""Policy seems to
be let people have ligatures to take responsiblity even if they have to be cut off many times
during the day.” This was not further investigated with AFG,

The Care Quality Commission (*CQC”) carried out an inspection of the Service on 6"" and
7"" March 2018 and published a report dated 24” July 2078, Having reviewed the records of
all eight patients at the Service, the CQC found that not all patients had written risk
assessments. Those risk assessments that were in place were poorly written and individual
risks to the patients and others were not suficienty mitigated. In five care records, although
risk assessments were present, they were not comprehensive. Risk management plans
lacked detail and, where a lavel of risk was identified for one patient, there was no evidence
of review or updates of the assessment. Following incidents, risk management plans were
‘ot updated. At the te ofthe inspection the staffing establishment lavels were below those
identified for the Service, This resulted in 50% of the shifts being filed by bank and agency
staff. The Service did not have a robust process for identifying the required staffing levels,
but the staf received appropriate training,

Overall, the service was rated as Inadequate.

The CQC carried out a further inspection of the Service on 13"" December 2018 and
published a report dated 27° February 2019. Overall, they found that that there had been
Improvements in patient risk assessments and theie review as wall as care plans. Lessons
learned from incidents were not always being shared with staff at the Service.

Mandatory training had not been completed by all eligible staff. Only half the qualified
nurses had completed intermediate Iife suppor training. Staff did not receive all the training
Fequired to perform ther roles prior to working with individuals. Staff did not have access to
specialist training to work with high-risk patients. Stafing leveis did not ensure that patients
had a consistent level of support and access to activities. Systems processes and standard
‘operating procedures were not reliable or appropriate to Keep people safe. Overall, the
Service was sil rated as Inadequate.

‘AFG submitted an application to the CQC to cancel the registration for Tesito House on the
21 February 2019 and COC removed the location from being a registered service provider
fon the 28 February 2019.The unit was then closed. The CQC did not cary out an
investigation themselves after Shona died because Tesito House had been de-ragistered
and closed although they could have done because she was a detained mental health
Patient

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS
During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my
pinion there isa risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the
circumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN aro as follows:

1. The lack of appropriate contemporaneous clinical record keeping by the nurse in
charge as well as other nurses,

2. The lack of appropriate contemporaneous cinical record keeping by the Support
Workers.

3. Patient observations were not being completed as directed and accurate records
were not being kept.

‘4. There was inadequate communication between the Nurse in Charge and Support
Workers about important clinical information relating to self-harm as well as
completion of observations and the records.

5. That patients could obtain ligatures and other objects that could be used for self-
harmisuicide andlor used against other patients and staff members.

6. Regular training on all the applicable policies/procedures and use of an Automated
Electronic Defibrillator.

7. Completion and updating of all care plans including risk assessments after MDT

“The investigation concluded atthe end ofthe inquest on 16% June 2022,

The medical cause of death was:
‘1a pressure on neck (hanging)

‘The conclusion of the inquest was as flows:

'An excessively elongated immigration process lating 17 years has led to significant
‘amplification of Kalid's well documented mental heath and housing issues. This cycle
(ofa lack of adequate housing to keep him safe and erratically prescribed medication
‘would have had a negative effect on his mental health. At times where risks by agencies
Involved were ideiiied there was a faure to ensure that Khali had the relevant
medication and housing to Keep him safe. There was @ systemic fare to consider
historic agsessment about his mental heath; rather agencies focussed on current
presentation with apparent distegard and curiosity about historical data. Khalid led a
‘chaotic Me and had a history of drug and substance use and had multiple contacts with
Government agencies. Khaki had demonstrated on many occasions treats to sel
harm and harm athers which were well document on Government systems, An
unsympathetic and desensitsed penal system with inadequate access to this data held
by relevant agencies and poor processes to ensure ths data is reviewed and actioned
probably led toa stuation in prison of Kad having the opportunity to take his own ite.
Khalid was at risk of suicide upon aval at prison; the prison and nursing staf folowed
‘an inadequate process without proper conskleration and communication of al relevant
‘ocumentation and historical data thal would have presented additional information and

@_| CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH
“The deceased was Khalid Abiaz

release from immigration detention in July 2016 experienced homelessness and three
fatlempts to take his own fe following which he was detained on each occasion under
2 of the Mental Heath Act 1983 (MHA). Khalid had a long history of mental health
issues and had been assessed on 3 August 2016 by a consultant psychiatrist as
posing a significant risk to himsetf and others. On 8 September 2016, folowing a threat
{o kil ise in the context of tying to get prescribed medication at a

by aligature inthe early hours of 13"" September 206.

5 | CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to a concern.
In opinion there is risk that future deaths wil occur unless action is taken. In the
Cireumtances itis my salutary duty to make report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5 of
the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners.
(Investigations) Reguiations 2013,

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as flows:

1. I neard evidence that folowing a review in 2016 changes tothe ACCT document
and process were ploted in 10 establishments in 2018 and this included HMP
‘Swansea, Asa result a revised ACCT version 6 and accompanying policy
(guidance wat issued. This revised guidance makes clea tat an ACCT must be
‘pened by any member of staf who receives information that indicates @
prisoner may be currently at isk of sell-harm or suicide and that tis information
‘ay come fom a prison escort However, this requirement isnot new. It was
‘dear in my view from the HMP Swansea Suicide and Prevention Policy that was
In place athe time of Khali's death that a waming marker for suicide on a
‘prison escort record (PER’ should result nthe opening ofan ACCT. The

he could not be revived. In hight of her history of
‘actions it could not be determined whether she intended to end her life

‘The narrative conclusion which I returned was:

Manon Jones died from ligaturing while suffering a mental health episode in
circumstances where she ought to have been subject to continuous 1:1
observation pending further assessment

‘The Inquest focused upon:-

1. The provision of community care in the week leading up t0 the

of observation and the placement of Manon in a bedroom with ligature
points

“The mental heath services went through a transformation process during the Covid

per day, atthe peak this rose to 30 and has curently reduced to 13-14 daly, s0 remains

insufficient capacity. The decision was made fo antr this ont the Trusts risk register,
land this remains tne siuation. The erica features remain a high demand for services|
land a lack of resources,

“This court has been tld on many occasions that there isan intention for “party” of mental

‘health services with physical health services, bul his enol apparent andthe sevice
Lnable fo meet its obligations now or going forward. This is greater than along waiting

discharged from that service on 2/3/21. On 3/3/21 Mr Nixon was
found suspended by a ligature in wooded grounds in North Dorset.

5 | CORONER'S CONCERNS

|

| The MATTERS OF CONCERN areas folows:

11. During the inquest evidence was heard that:

Mr Nixon was not known to mental health services prior to
February 2021.

Me Nixon's INH accompanied him to every appointment he
had with the Home Treatment Team. She had never had dealings
with the Mental Health Services previously.

Me Nixon had given permission tothe Mental Heath Services to
share information with On one occasion it was
deemed that doctor could not mpart patient information to Me
Nixon's (NH beceuse he wrongly thought he did not have
permission fom the patent todo $0.

Mr Noxon (MIN wes unaware that he had disclosed

“occasional suicidal thoughts” and was therefore unable to assess |

the risk of Mr Nixon to himself and accordingly did not take any
steps to protect him.

‘The Care Pian, Escalation Pian, Emergency Plan were not drawn
up in writing until after Mr Nixon’s death. No paperwork was sent
to Mr Nixon (and in turn not seen by his partner) by the Home
‘Treatment Team prior to his death. Mr Nixon's parmer was not
‘therefore party to or privy to any risk assessment.

A Carer's Assessment was. considered but thought not
appropriate as it was believed that Mr Nixon's IIKho was
Present at all consultations withthe Home Treatment Team) was
part of what was seen as “an intelligent and resourceful couple”.

‘The Trust has a patient information leaflet describing what
support and advice can be given to a carer. There is a Carer
Assessment tool available.

72. Thave concerns with regard to the following:

‘The failure to ensure that family members/carers are fully
Involved from the outset in the risk assessment process and that
they have a full comprehension of steps being taken and/or
decisions being made. I believe the Trust should take a more
proactive approach.

li, There should be criteria to be applied as to who should be
considered for a Carers Assessment at the earliest appointment
with the Home Treatment Team. Such criteria should include
‘whether the patient has given permission to share information;
Whether the patient and/or the carer have been involved with
mental health services previously; whether the carer has
been/will be present during consultations; the level of
Understanding of the carer in relation to steps taken and
decisions made and whether they need further help.

lil, Such criteria may lead to a full carers assessment. It is noted
that there will always be a delay between assessments and the
‘drawing up of care plans etc wihich will then be sent out to the
patient. By establishing an early process of engaging with carers
the medical professionals may build in further protective factors
for the patient.

""ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths and
believe you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action.

‘YOUR RESPONSE

You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this
report, 1"" August 2022. I, the coroner, may extend the period.

Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken,

‘The medical cause of death was: -

‘of his risk of sel-harm inthe months preceding his death & whether such
‘menegement may have contibuted to his death

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

‘A the conclusion ofthe inquest, | directed writen submissions from the three Interested
Person's as to whether my duty under Regulation 28 was engaged & if so, in respect of
which matters.

{have received & considered the same.
‘During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken Inthe
Cercumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

(1) The assessment of Sam's risk of settharm was recorded by his care-co-
‘ordinator in @ Wales Applied Risk Research Network (WARN) assessment tol
in March 2019. This form of assessment was adopted by the integrated Mental
Health Services (Powys County Council & Powys Teaching Health Board) in
Powys. | also received evidence that ts used throughout Wales by simiar

(2) The evidence | received indicated thatthe WARRN assessment
\documentation/ool could be routinely accessed, updated & revised by the
Integrated Team. Iwas a fuid document forthe purpose of recording
information 3s tothe current assessment of rsk(s) of sel-harm & how that
risks) was tobe mitigated. Whilst | received evidence that in practice, such risk
assessments were being undertaken with Sam, the WARRN documentation id
not necessarily reflect that, nor was i optimally viewable in terms of clearly
Fecording fluctuating presentations & any accompanying re-ascessment of risk

(@) lt appeared to me that the formatlayout ofthe WARRN too, its accessibily, &
In partcular, ts ablity to provide a user wih clear & easily viewable information
‘a to how Sam’ rik of se-harm had fuctuatedalteredichanged in the months
‘receding his deat, could lead to important information/assessments being lost
toa newintequent user. This, for example, might be a new care co-ordinator
(68 n Sam's case}, Crisis TeavCommunity Nurse, or cinician not previously
Involved with Sam:

(4) Given the variety of services involved in Sam's care, this cenval document,
‘addressing & recording fuctuatng risk appeared to me to be a crucial document
in the recording of current risk (my emphasis). The abilty of those charged with
Sam's care to view those fluctuations might be hampered by the current
presentation ofaccess to such information. That could lead to an under
‘estimation ofthe current risk & sub-optimal mitigating measures being putin
place.

(6) The WARRN assessment tol might also benefit rom a greater degree of
Interaction between it& the user For example, twas clear, on the evidence that,
Social Worker's, Mental Hah Nurses & Cinicians were all busy addressing the
needs (& assessing risk) of a wide number & varity of patients. Prompting (my
‘emphasis) the user to consider & record referrals for, for example, to.
services & for eapacty assessments might optimise the benefits of the tol &
‘reduc the isk of such opportunites being missediun-recorded. Such then
leading tothe potential absence of key information for newinfrequent users
when assessing risks of seltharm

may well be helpful (given the Integrated Services approach o Mental Heath Services
in Powys) itt were to receive one jmtly prepared response from both organisations to

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST
(On 2 February 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of SAIFUR RAHMAN. Thel
investigation concluded a the end of ajury inquest held between 9-20 May 2022.

(CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH
[The jury's factual finding

Ssaifur Rahman was a recognised drug user. twas reported that he was using mamba
jwhich contributed to the decline in his mental health. On the 16 November 2020, he was
ieranded at HMP Birmingham and on the 21 November he was admitted tothe health
are ward fora period of assessment. In early December he was diagnosed with Bi-polar
iisorder with mixed affective state and was treated with medication, Saifur Rahman's
presentation on ward two was varied. At times he was amicable and would engage with
lthers, at other times he was unpredictable and uncommunicative. He occasionally
lexpressed odd beliefs and aggressive behaviours. However, he showed no self-harm or
luicda ideation. An ACCT, was not considered necessary. In early January 2021 he was
jnon-cancordant with his medication. On 9 January he was moved to cell 3-15 due to
(damage and graffiti of his previous cell. nthe 17 January, his unlock status was increased)
to custody manager plus three prison oficers in ful personal protective equipment. This
}was a consequence of his previous aggressive and anti-social behavior. A relative
telephoned the prison on 18 January, parties to the conversation report different
laccounts. However, it resulted in an application form for an additional number being
ladded to Saifur Rahman's contacts. An officer presented the form atthe cell and
[conducted a welfare check. The outcome of his lat psychiatric assessment on 19 January
Wwas for Sifur Rahman to remain on healtheare, to record compliance with his medication
land continue to monitor behaviour. The assessment ralzed na concerns regarding self.
jnarm or suicidal ideation. Mr Rahman's presentation on the 20 January leading up tothe
incident raised no cause for concern. He was last seen alive at approximately 16:25 hours
jwhen he was delivered @ meal through his cell door hatch. At approximately 17:00 hours
(during the medicine round, he could nat be seen through the eal door hatch and he did
Inot respond when called. The observation hole into the internal toilet recess had been
(damaged via a burn mark and crack. There was no evidence as to how or when this
hhappened. The dome mirror was also missing, s0 it was not possible to see into the recess
lrea. The prison officers expected tobe assaulted on entering the cll from the toilet
recess. Therefore, unlock status was followed and cell entry occurred at around 17-13,

hours Me ehnen 2: i |

He was lifted, placed on the flor and found to be in cardiac
frrest The prison officers commenced CPR. From the evidence given, iti likely that
lardiac arrest occurred between 16:37 hours and 17:10 hours. The code blue call was
(delayed by up to'a minute, but this did not contribute to his death. Prison nurses arrived
land assisted with CPR. A defibrilator was applied but detected no shockable rhythm.
Paramedic arrived at H3-15 at 17:35 hours. Return of spontaneous circulation was
lachieved but he remained unconscious and was taken to City Hospital, atriving at 18:16
hours. He remained very unwell and despite continued treatment died on 23 January
12021. Post-mortem examination canfirmed there had been a suficient period of reduced
jolood and oxygen supply to the brain, resulting in irreversible injury. It is known that wher}
[commissioned H3-15 was intended for infectious prisoners who needed to shower in
fsolation, The shower was decommissioned but the shower head was left in situ, Iti
junknown when or why it was decommissioned. In November 2017 H3-15 was taken out of
juse following damage tothe cell including damage to the dome miror andthe bed. In
bly 2020 H3-15 began to be used again without the mirror. No explanation was provided
fs to why. The 2020 cell NM risk assessment conducted by the mental health trust did
int identify the gisused shower head in H3-15. The pracess was non-standard and
(conducted over the telephone due to Covid-19 restrictions.

Following a post-mortem the medical cause of death was confirmed as: 1a
Hypoxic/schaemic encephalopathy 1b External neck compression 1

[The jury's conclusion:

Saitur Rahman died from I Which caused external neck compression which led to
hnypoxic/ischaemic encephalopathy. Mr Rahman's intention when fashioning the

Fisk assessments conducted by the mental health trust were insufficiently recorded due to
infective sampling methods, non-identifiction of cel ifferences and reliance on
historical records. The prison weekly fabric checks conducted by custody managers were
insufficiently recorded,

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS
During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In
ly opinion there isa rsk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the
(cumstances itis my statutory duty to report ta you,

[The MATTERS OF CONCERN areas follows. ~

1. Calling “code blue”: the evidence evealed thatthe safety critical cde blue call
~ automatically triggering an emergency response - was delayed by up to2
minutes. The evidence was inconsistent an whether the cel entry briefing
Included the identification ofan extra officer with a radio, and why therefore an

officer in fall person protective equipment ran out ofthe call and across the ward
to here she had lefther radio to cal the code blue, Delayed cade blue calls have
‘been a repeated problem at HMP Birmingham despite it being raised by the
Prison and Probation Ombudsman and coroners in earlier regulation 28 reports,
‘My ongoing concern is that delayed code blue calls will continue, and
consideration should be given to the effectiveness of training in ight of the
evidence given by the prison officers atthe inquest.

Collhistory: the evidence revealed that cel fabric history - including fabric
changes, damage and repairs -is safety critical information. information about the
bistory of cell H3-15 was lost or unclear asi transversed control ofthe prison
changing from GS to national control in 2018-2019 and there was no prison
smaster/central record. My ongoing concern s that HMP Birmingham does not
curcently have a master/central record of cell history and relies on Amey who
hhave a national contract for cell fabric changes and repairs. The evidence was
unclear on whether the prison would have access to this safety critical
Information ifthe third party contractor changed.

‘NHS annual sk assessment: the evidence revealed that the mental
health trust assessors had historically only cip-sampled a selection ofthe 15 x2
cells on health care ward 2 (physical health) and ward 3 (mental health). They did
not record which ells had been visually checked and relied in parton second
hand information from the prison about eel fabric and design. There had not
been effective communication between the prison and heath care staf.
Generally the trust had 140+ buildings across its entice estate to assess, this was
done by two members of the health and safety team, and the assessment of the
health care unit at HMP Birmingham was expected tobe completed over several
hours on one day. was provided with a verbal undertaking that the trust would
‘ow vsualy inspect al 15x 2 cells annually. However, this relies exclusively on
the co-operation ofthe prison who have competing tensions given the
‘operationally dynamic and challenging environment, especially i cells are
‘occupied during the assessment. My ongoing concernis that there is no
formalised process between the prison and mental health trust to visually inspect
cach cll. tis recognised prisoners housed on ward 2 and 3 are at a much greater
‘isk of suicide than the general prison population, and general public asa whole,
and will spend a great deal of time unobserved in the 1532 eels. Therefor, in m
view, visually inspecting 30 cells isnot disproportionate to the level of risk and is
rot comparable to assessing an outpatient bulding inthe community. The
dynamic and challenging environment means ts likly all els cannot be
inspected on one vst. Visually inspecting each cell therefore needs to be propery
planned and resourced by bth the prison and mental health trast and
consideration needs to be given toa formal process.

Prion isk assessment: the evidence revealed that dynamic daily and
\weetiy prison officer cal fabric checks didnot identity the rsks with coll H3-a5,
‘The evidence from the mental health trust was that as ther risk assessment i

‘annual and the environment on ward 2 and ward 3s dynamic and ean quickly
change, the prison needs to undertake its own I risk assessment. was,
provided witha verbal undertaking that the head of safer custody will undertake
the first annual prison cell MM isk assessment visually inspecting all 15 x2
cells 6 months after the NHS rk assessment, and delegate twelve monthly
thereaft

concern is that thee i no formalised process and consideration needs to be given
tohhow results ofthe prison NM isk assessment is communicated to, and
acted upon, by the mental health trust

resulting in alternating 6 monthly risk assessments. My ongoing

3 | INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

‘On 20% April 2022 I commenced and concluded an investigation into the
death of Matthew John Evans.

The medical cause of death given was:
Ja, Suspension
I determined that on the 16"" June 2021 Matthew John Evans was found

deceased 2 TE, Folly 4ll hai
HR 61 the intention of ending his lite

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Matthew was a 47-year-old man who worked in IT and was fit and well
with no underlying medical or mental health difficulties. On or around
December 2020, despite coping well with the 2 previous Covid-19
lockdowns he began catastrophising and developed insomnia through the
third lockdown. This worsened and he sought help from his General
Practitioner in April 2021,

Matthew sent an email regarding his insomnia to his GP who thereafter
had a telephone consultation on April 14 2021, referring Matthew for
Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) for insomnia.

Matthew had CBT with TalkPlus between April and July 2022. His initial
depression and anxiety (PHQ-9 and GAD-7) scores were in the severe
range and had deteriorated further when recalculated at the end of the
sessions. In May 2021, he indicated a suicide risk of 5/10 and 4/10 on the
final session. His suicide risk was discussed with other practitioners but
referral to further mental health care was not considered warranted. After
his last session Matthew was recommended to have a more intensive
‘course of CBT which had not commenced at the time of his death.

TalkPlus sent a letter to the GP outlining the care to be offered to Matthew
and thereafter a follow up letter indicating the care they had provided
Both these letters indicated Matthew was suffering from insomnia, anxiety
and depression with the severe PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores.

Matthew had further telephone consultations, with his GP on 27% May, 2!
and 9 June 2021 all of which were initiated by him via email. His request
for sleeping medication was initially refused but after a further request he
‘was prescribed Zopiclone. On 9 June 2021 he was prescribed Mirtazapine
for ongoing anxiety, depression and insomnia. On the 16"" June 2021 he
ended his life.

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS
1, ‘The actions of the General Practitioner

The GP was not sufficiently proactive with multiple lost opportunities to
provide better care and support for Matthew. The GP did not undertake a
‘mental health assessment to assess the severity of Matthew's difficulties
and to ascertain whether further support or referral to secondary mental
health care were indicated in any of the four telephone consultations. He
did not ask or document at any time if Matthew had any suicidal ideation
or acts of self-harm. The GP did not offer a face-to-face consultation or
arrange a follow up appointment. The GP declined to prescribe Zopiclone
and whilst he referred Matthew to the benefits of Melatonin he did not
offer a prescription. He prescribed Mirtazepine having not done so before
for someone in Matthews position on a background of having no post
‘graduate qualifications in mental health. Furthermore, he did not
document any warning of the possible side-effects of this drug including
the possible increased risk of suicidal ideation with commencing the
drug, It is unclear whether the GP had read the letters from TalkPlus. He
did not ask permission as to whether it was possible to inform or involve
Matthew's partner and family in his on-going care.

2. The actions of the General Practice

No policy was provided to assist GP's with prescribing of Mirtazapine
and antidepressants and anxiolyties in general practice. There is no
confirmation electronic letters have been signed as read and acted upon
by the relevant GP. No evidence was provided with regard to ongoing
training in mental health for GP’s. Matthew's death was not investigated
‘or reviewed by the GP practice with the consequence no learning points
have been considered or, if necessary, changes implemented, giving rise
to concern aver the lack of robust clinical governance procedure within
the practice,

3, The actions of TalkPlus

There does not appear to be robust guidance or a policy as to the
threshold necessary to refer a patient to secondary mental health services,
in Matthew’s circumstances where his mental health had deteriorated as
the sessions proceeded and he had began to indicate suicidal ideation
and self-harm on a background of no previous mental health difficulties,

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN
In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I
believe that the people listed in paragraph one have the power to take
such action,

YOUR RESPONSE
You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of its date;
‘may extend that period on request

Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be
taken, setting out the timetable for such action. Otherwise, you must
explain why no action is proposed.

‘COPIES
Thave sent a copy of this report to the following:
1, See names in paragraph 1 above

In addition to this report, Iam under a duty to send the Chief Coroner a
copy of your response.

The Chief Coroner may publish either or both in a complete or redacted
or summary form. He may send a copy of this report to any person who,
he believes, may find it useful or of interest. You may make
representations to me at the time of your response, about the release or
the publication of your response by the Chief Coroner.

DATED this 18% Day of May 2022

",1007,"1. The actions of the General Practitioner:
   - The GP was not proactive enough in providing care and support for Matthew.
   - The GP did not conduct a mental health assessment to determine the severity of Matthew's difficulties or consider referral to secondary mental health care.
   - The GP did not inquire about suicidal ideation or self-harm and did not offer a face-to-face consultation or follow-up appointment.
   - The GP declined to prescribe certain medications and did not inform Matthew of possible side effects.
   - The GP did not involve Matthew's partner and family in his care.

2. The actions of the General Practice:
   - The General Practice did not provide a policy to guide prescribing of Mirtazapine and antidepressants.
   - There is no confirmation that electronic letters were read and acted upon.
   - There is no evidence of ongoing mental health training for GPs.
   - Matthew's death was not investigated or reviewed by the GP practice, indicating a lack of robust clinical governance procedures.

3. The actions of TalkPlus:
   - There is no robust guidance or policy regarding the threshold for referring patients to secondary mental health services.
   - Matthew's deteriorating mental health and indication of suicidal ideation were not appropriately addressed.

Overall, the concerns raised by the coroner include inadequate care and support provided by the GP, lack of policies and training in the General Practice, and insufficient guidance in TalkPlus for referring patients to secondary mental health services.","Matthew John Evans, a 47-year-old man, died by suspension with the intention of ending his life on June 16, 2021. He had sought help from his General Practitioner for insomnia, anxiety, and depression, and had received Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) sessions. However, his mental health deteriorated, and despite indicating a suicide risk, he was not referred to further mental health care. He was prescribed medication for anxiety, depression, and insomnia, but ended his life before commencing a more intensive course of CBT. The report highlights concerns regarding the GP's lack of proactive care and support, the lack of policies and training in the GP practice, and the absence of robust guidance for referring patients to secondary mental health services.",Hanging/Suspension,"Mental Health Services and Crisis Management; Healthcare Coordination and Continuity; Policy, Procedure, and Protocol Compliance; Staffing, Training, and Resource Allocation; Investigation, Reporting, and Accountability",Other/Unknown

Mental

Health Act 1983 only and the lac of application of s41 Mental Health Act 1883 in

‘case of ths severly. I appears that the inal diagnosis of dementia along withthe
Defendant's age may have been signfican factors in thal decision however its plan
thal the eventual diagnosts ofthis individual id not account forthe index offence.
Unfortunately, because Marjorie was only detained under s37 Mental Healt Act 1983
this didnot allow for any monitoring of he by criminal justine agencies suchas te

During the course of tho inquest the evidence revealed matters giving ise to concern. tn
‘yy opinion there isa risk that future deaths could oceur unless action is taken. ln the
Clecumstances I is my statutory ly to repor 10 you,

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

1. The clinical evidence which he Ministy of Justice obtained in Mrs Grayson's
criminal proceedings was very clear of two things (a) Mrs Grayson should not
retum home alone as she was likely 1o have deteriorated whistin prison and

‘Care and sho had expressed sucdal or soi harm related Thoughts and (6) she
should nol be retumed to the care of her family because, as unikly as it may
‘sound, she posed a continued risk to her family.

2. The Ministry of Justice evidence lurther asserted that there was no requrement
foras4i Order becase there was no riskto the pubic.

3. Unfortunately, the two things expressedin the Ministry of Juste evidence,
‘namely that irs Grayson should not return homealone to care for hers and
thal she should nat be returned tothe cere of her ‘amily is exact the approach
that was taken with Mes Grayson vith the result being Mis Grayson's death

4. lam unclear why members of Mis Graysons family. who do not reste with her
‘ordinatly and a the time of her offending, ae not regarded as members o! the
public forthe purposes o a s41 Order. The risk of harm to them was car inthe
‘rind ofthe author and had they been togarded as members ofthe pubic this
‘may have led toa $41 Order being made which, although potentally making no
dlerence in this ease may do in others,

5.  Shelfield Health and Social Care Trust determined todo with Mrs Grayson upon
discharge did not pay sulicient heed othe lineal evidence obtained by the
Ministry of Jusios and which was rellcted in the practice at St Andrew's

6. Shollield Health and Social Care Trust do nat seem to have joned up the
‘actions thal were cacommended from the Criminal Justice proceedings an the
‘work undertaken at St Andrews resulting ina discharge which id not
‘adequately reflect the risks to and trom Mrs Grayson,

1

OFFICIAL SENSVE
‘During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matiors giving rise To concern
Inmy opinion there isa risk thal future deaths Could occur unless action is taken. In
‘the crcumstances iis my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN aro 8 follows. ~

“The evidence indicated
1 Zoe was diagnosed al age 16 years as being autistic by CAMHS with a designation
of Asperger's Syndrome. Her medical records recorded that,

2 n or about 2016 she was wrongly attributed by the Mental Health Service, TEWV.
Clinicians - who knew of her autism -as undergoing Emotionally Unstable Personality
Disorder CEUPO.

{3 That attribution was na formally diagnosed, and not discussed with Zoe who found
‘ut by chance when looking at her records. She continued tobe regarded and
treated a8 i she was experiencing that condltion and crcians would not adapt to her
distress caused by that attibution. There was ineria and excessive deay (to May
2020) in removing reference to EUPD which had been discounted in October 2018 all
‘Of which added to her distress. These actions and inactions destroyed her
felationship with community mental health clinicians and she dd not ust them
‘enough o by to restore any effective are relationship,

4. She suffered repeated trauma derived from her autistic condition revising the
‘causes of her distress which she re-experienced time and again wit fim ree?
recolection. That vauma was again not understood.

5 In short, her autism (and thus sk assessment) was misunderstood by the clinicians
{asked to keep her safe

‘6 TEWV's provision fr cares of autistic conditions were underdeveloped, electing
national want of provision to include:-

‘Arno multiiscpinary clinical assessment and formulation addressed her autism;

£8 no reasonable adjustments were then made in terms of her sensory and
‘environmental needs in any timely fashion or ata

CC no person centred (thus autism centred) holistic plan was developed to work in
partnership with Zoe that took account of her autism, and her gender. As the
evidence revealed one ‘cannot uncouple autism and other psychologicallpsychiatic
‘experionces. Instead, she withdrew from engagement with TEWV community health

D there was no local provision within TEWY for specialist autism assessment and
‘adapted psychological therapy. Commissioned providers ofthese essential cares
‘Were outwith TEWVV, requiring specie Funding Request (which was granted) for &
Course of assessment and therapy. Those providers didnot offer statutory acute
‘mental health services suppor, including out of hourslersis suppor. TEWV did not
provide what the commissioned providers were supplying. Thare was a want of
‘effective communications between these teams’ not least as patient data was not
‘accessible by one tothe others electronic records (patient consent permiting) and the
{act of disengagement. There was a sense of'slo' working, iting against
partnership working, that encouraged unfavourably the undesirabie “uncoupling” of
experiences;

E statistical evidence indicated that autistic individuals are more at risk of suide
than those with ne neurodevelopmental condition, and females at greater risk that
thair male counterparts

‘OFFICIAL SENSITIVE

F there was a cinical (but nol measured) experience that more palionts were
presenting tothe slatutory service with autiste conditions and, itolows, more
patents would be a sk of suicide;

G from 2016 to her death, Zoe was detained under ss 2/3 MHA 1983 17 tines and
presented to A and E around 37 times wih evident self harm and apparent attempts
‘on her ife. She repeated high risk behaviours. She had no Care Co-ordinator nor
effective Care Pian (which ought to have been in place) because she had not
fengaged with TEWV communty services:

H Zoe lurched form crisis to crisis remaining thigh risk to her own safety; she
‘ied tecause she could no longer cope withthe sense of injustice caused by thers
that overwhelmed her thinking. She felt she was not being listed to by community
‘mental health services. Her therapy rom outside providers - which was proving
helpful o her - was disrupted by COVIO-19 limitations on face to face consullaons:

Both local, including regional, but also nationally the evidence revealed a number of
serious issues that require urgent and immediate action to support autistic people
wel, not just from a sensory and environmental bass (which TEWV have started to
Improve albeit from a lw baseline according to the evidence received). Urgent
‘solutions are required to prevent future deaths of autistic patents especially with

CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS

| make this report under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009,
paragraph 7, Schedule §. and

‘The Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013,
regulations 28 and 29.

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

On the 8 November, 2021 Assistant Coroner Sarah Bourke began an
investigation into the death of James Forryan who died aged 29, on the
29 October, 2021 atthe Novotel Hotel, 40 Marsh Wall, London E14.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15"" March,
2022 conducted by myself, Assistant Coroner Edwin Bucket

Tmade a determination at inquest that the deceased died as a result of
suicide which was caused by him deliberately taking @ poisonous
quantity of pentobarbital medication.

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

James Forryan was a young man with a mild history of depression and
anxiety.

(On the 28"" October 2021 he checked into a hotel in London and took at
[east the fatal dose of pentobarbital medication which caused his
death on the 29"" October 2021 whist staying at that hotel

The post-mortem and toxicology evidence revealed that his death was
caused by a pentobarbital overdose.

CORONER'S CONCERNS.

During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving
rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur
unless action is taken. In the circumstances, itis my statutory duty to
report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows,
Evidence was given that:

1. James had accessed a forum on the internet known to promote
suicide. That website and the forum discussions attached to it
provided advice and guidance on:

() Appropriate drugsimedication which would produce a
terminal result;

(i) Which drugs were most effective;

(ii) How they should be taken;

(iv) How they could be purchased:

(v) End of life planning,

2. James was careful and methodical in the actions he took to end
his life. He appeared to follow some guidance on the steps to take
from a “handbook which the family believe was generated from a
suicide promoting website and his decision to acquire the
pentobarbital medication was informed by the that website.

8. The suicide promoting website appeared to act as a trigger in his
decision to take his ov life.

am concerned that:

(@) There are websites and forums which openly promote and
advertise methods of suicide which are easily accessible;

(b) Suicide is the largest cause of death for individuals in the UK
under the age of 35 and James Forryan is within that age bracket

(c) There does not appear to be sufficient regulation or enforcement
action against such websites which promote criminal offences
and/or harmful content.

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and |
believe that you andlor your organisation have the power to take such
action

YOUR RESPONSE

You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days ofthe date
ofthis report, namely by 27"" May 2022. |, the coroner, may extend the

Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be
taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain
why no action is proposed.

‘The jury found in this case that the deceased could not be seen at all times whist in

(On the 7 April 2021 an onboard supervisor (OBS) for Govia Thamestink Railway Ltd
noticed Kaja on Barham Station at about 8.00am, The same OBS noticed Kaja
boarding her train at Barnham station at 11.0Sam. Kaja got off at another station but
the OBS was concerned about her welfare. The OBS invited Kaja to get back onto the
twain and then contacted the Govia Thameslink Railway control room raising her
concerns about Kaja’s vulnerability. The OBS did not report the concerns to the police
and the Govia Thameslink Railway witnesses gave evidence that this would have been
the recommended course of action,

‘The Govia Thameslink Railway control room staff agreed that the OBS would hand
Kaja over to the station staff at Havant train station, The control room staff then made
contact with Brighton train station (as Kaja’s reported destination), Havant station and
conductors on a number of trains. After Kaja had left Havant station the control room

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to
concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is
taken, In the circumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you,

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(1) heard evidence from the Suicide Prevention Manager for Govia Thameslink

Railway Lid that taining on dealing with vulnerable persons was not mandatory for
frontline staff

In fact only 583 out of 7,500 staf had attended a course run by the Samaritans entitled
‘Managing Suicidal Contacts, 40% had completed some e-learning and an unknown
‘number had completed an internal course. In addition refresher taining on this issue
‘was an aspiration only and had not been rolled out by Govia Thameslink Railway Ltd

I also heard evidence that the Suicide Prevention Manager for Govia Thameslink
Railway Lid did not have any input into the taining for theit team based in the joint
control room,

Tam therefore concerned that those members of staff most likely to have contact with
‘vulnerable or suicidal persons, as well as those responsible for assisting frontline staff
are not all properly tained to deal with the situation in the best possible way.

(2) Iheard evidence that Govia Thameslink Railway Lid staff control room staff relied
‘upon a protocol entitled “Person ill ona train’ when a vulnerable person was reported
to them, The witness responsible for the Govia Thameslink Railway conteol room
team accepted that this was not an appropriate document fo rely upon as it made no
‘mention of vulnerable persons

Tam therefore concerned that the control room staff do not have the appropriate
information to assist their colleagues and to arrange an appropriate response when a
“eoncern for welfare"" report is made to them,

(3) I heard evidence that the Govia Thameslink Railway Ltd control room staff did not
Tog all actions taken after the concern for welfare report.

Tam concerned that itis not possible to assess whether all reasonable and appropriate
actions were taken by the control room staff and whether individuals or teams have
further training needs.

Decent Tone Ups SOOT RET
@ The Govia Thameslink Railway Ltd control room staff did not contact Baitish
‘Transport Police, 999 nor share the information about this ‘concern for welfare” report
‘with Network Rail despite having a joint control room,

[heatd evidence that there was no written protocol covering when Govia Thameslink
Railway Lid staff should share a “concern for welfare"" report with Network Rail staff
in the shared control room,

Tam concered that there is not appropriate information sharing and reporting to other
luding British Transport Police, when a ‘concern for welfare” is raised

‘ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (a
‘your organisation) have the power to take such action,

‘YOUR RESPONSE

“The matters of concem are as follows:

7. Evidence was heard ofa histor clture of bullying and harassment within the Crisis
Resolution Home Treatment Team wich has led faa loss of compassion in some instances
‘withthe view that some suicides are inevilable""and tome reluctance to recognise wien
Casas shouldbe referred tothe Team. Work has bean undertaken by the Trust to improve
Such cultural atitudes. However, itwas rocognised in evidence that there is “tl distance
to go"" and aroas where the culture needs to change. Its of concern that this culture remains
trae years following Theo's death

2, Following an Assessment, a person is til discharged frm the Community Team without any
immodiate “check: or discussion as ta the corracness of this decison. It vas heard tal
following Theo's death immediate discharge from the Communily Team folowing assassmont
is relatvaly rare. In these creumstances, uch a dacussion would not place an onerous

death was recorded as-

1a Multiple Injuries

‘The conclusion of the inquest was suicide.

4 | CIRCUMSTANGES OF THE DEATH

Matthew was 36 years old at the time of his death. Matthew had struggled
with his mental health throughout his adult Ife. In 2020 his mental health
deteriorated leading toa number of crisis presentations to hospital in April
land May for assessment under the Mental Health Act. He was diagnosed
with a Personality Disorder which was characterised by his changeable
presentation, difficulty in regulating his emotions and his experience of

‘becoming distressed, being Impulsive and having inusive thoughts of
self-harm and suicide. Matthew had been a heroin user in the past but
hhad not used heroin for over a decade and was prescribed opiate
substitutes.

(On the 22nd July 2020 Matthew was sentenced to a Community
Rehabilitation Order and was subject to supervision by probation. In
‘August he was referred by probation to the Salford Criminal Justice Team
provided by Greater Manchester Mental Health Trust. Matthew was also
seeing a Substance Misuse worker at Achieve and by August 2020 had
started sessions aimed at a full detox from Subutex. He was also referred
to the Community Mental Health Team. They assessed Matthew in
‘September 2020 and referred him to a community-based psychiatrist
‘The assessment determined that Matthew did not require the Care
Programme Approach and therefore he was not allocated a Care
Coordinator.

On the 29th October, there were concems about Matthew's behaviour.
Police attended and took him to hospital to be assessed under the Mental
Health Act. He was then discharged back to police custody. Whitin
police custody between the 30th October and 2nd November Matthew
‘made repeated threats to his own life.

Matthew appeared before Magistrates on the 2nd November, where he
was made subject to ball conditions that restricted his access to entering
the area where his children lived and from having contact with their
mother. Family and particularly his children were very important to
Matthew. Later on, the 2nd November, Matthew presented as very
distressed to his probation officers. They were concern about the risk he
presented to himself had increased and were aware that one of his
protective factors, namely bis children had been impacted by his ball
Conditions, they conveyed him to hospital for assessment by the Mental
Health Liaison Team. He was seen but not assessed as requiring an
inpatient admission under the Mental Health Act. As a result of his bail
conditions, Matthew lost an allocation of housing that he had been
ooking forward to moving into near friends and family. This would likely
have had a further impact of Matthew's mental health

(On the Sth November 2020 Matthew had a conversation with a Children’s
Social Worker from which its ikely that he believed that his access to his
children would need to be supervised. This is also likely to have had an
impact on Matthew's mental health.

(On Monday 9th November 2020, Matthew was of no fixed abode and had
been staying with friends in the Stockport area. He contacted his,
substance misuse worker to find out when their next appointment was.

During that conversation, Matthew told her that he was thinking about
going to buy heroin to end bis life. His worker reminded him of protective
factors and of their future appointments. Matthew then spake to his

‘probation officer, and repeated that he had thought about buying heroin
to end his lfe, but he expressed an intention to keep attending
appointments and said he did not now have any intention to buy
substances. His Probation Officer later sent him by text the details of
temporary accommodation in the North Manchester Area. Matthew also

to Matthew's needs and that this co-ordinated approach could have led to
a fuller understanding by those agencies as a whole of the risks he posed
to himself, particularly from the 23th October onwards and an opportunity
to put in place an effective risk management plan. Therefore, this lack of

to his death,

Conclusion: Suicide

CORONER'S CONCERNS,

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

Matthew McManus had complex mental health and social care needs. He
was in contact with a significant number of agencies many of which
focused on the risk that Matthew posed to others. However, the evidence
before me, particularly that of the Salford Safeguarding Board indicates
that no -one saw Matthew as the vulnerable adult he was and addressed
how his own complex needs were to be met, either through a Care Act
assessment or any other means.

(on behaif of the Safeguarding Board who conducted a
‘Safeguarding Adult Review told the Inquest that there was no one person
for agency co-ordinating his support and care, meaning that Matthew did
not have a single point of contact to help him understand and navigate
the services being offered to him. This became particularly concerning
when Matthew's mental health declined, making him more erratic and
dificult to contact. This left already stretched services to do what they
Ccould to pull information together from their own resources or
conversations with other agencies. Without proper co-ordination, there
was no full information sharing, joint assessment, or joint planning of
Matthew's support, which meant there was never a full appreciation of the
risk he posed to himself, and no real care plan was in place to manage
that risk.

Without a clear pathway for agencies to jointly assess and co-ordinate
care in the case of adults with complex mental health and social care
needs, | am concerned that future deaths will occur.

Jake ticked ‘no’ for each of these questions. The following day Jake took his own

In connection with the self-assessment form there was no evidence of any
consideration being given to the need for sensitive questions raised in the form to
be discussed with Jake by a professional before Jake completed the form,

Evidence was taken from police on the subject of the risk assessment forms used
by police. These forms do include questions whether an individual intends to harm
Cr kill themselves. This form is never sent to individuals but is always completed
by the individual with an officer present, that officer being required to explain and,
if necessary, contextualise the questions.

The court heard that the guidance to the self-assessment form issued by the Youth
Justice Board makes no express reference to the need for consideration to be
given and documented as to whether the self-assessment form needs to be
discussed with a vulnerable young person before completion of the form. The
guidance examined at the Inquest was a document entitled ‘AssetPlus guidance

Jake had ne history of any mental health conditions, o any history of self-harm or
suicidal ideation. There was no evidence from friends and family of any warning
sign as to Jake’s state of mind,

Toxicological examination was negative, in other words no drugs or alcohol were
found in samples of blood taken from Jake after death,

CIRCUMSTANCES

‘OF THE DEATH

‘Oskar Nash was 14 years old when he died. He had been diagnosed with autism at
the age of 4 years and he suffered associated high anxiety throughout his life. lis,
likely that he also had one or more undiagnosed emotional or mental health
condition(s). Oskar hada very significant history of periodic suicidal ideation and
history of self-harm, the risk of both of which receded when his needs were
sufficiently supported,

‘Oskar was well known to the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service and to
Children’s Services, having been the subject of a number of referrals to both. His
education was managed by the Special Educational Needs Department of his local
‘authority as he had been issued with an Educational, Health and Care Plan, All
state agencies concerned with Oskar had knowledge of his history of suicidal
ideatio

In March 2019 Oskar transferred froma special needs school to a mainstream
school. Initially he appeared to cope, but from early November 2019 onwards, he
regulatly refused to attend school and.a period of escalating risk followed.
Referrals were made to CAMHS and Children’s Services but Oskar did not
receive any effective support.

On the 98 January 2020, Oskar Nash gained access (o an arcs 0

‘CORONER'S CONCER?

‘The evidence heatd tthe inquest revealed many matters giving rise to concern,
‘The evidence received at the prevention of future deathshearing showed that
many of those concerns have been addressed.

Inthe

However, in my opinion the following concerms remainand give
‘continuing risk that future deaths could occur unless action is take
circumstances itis my statutory duty o report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows

AL

irrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust

Concern 1
‘The evidence at the inquest revealed that the staff responsible forthe wiage of
referrals to child! mental health services had insufficient understanding of Autism,
its links o co-morbid mental health conditions, sel-harm and suividal ideatio
‘and how to communicate with an autistic child. Ihave been told thatthe triaging
process is now undertaken by an “Access and Advice Team” but am concemed
that there continues to be no requirement for the staff in that Team to undertake
relevant Autism taining on a mandatory bass.

Concern?
‘The evidence atthe inquest revealed that, despite a series of referrals to child
‘mental health services over many years, Oskar Nash never received the clinical
the needed. Thave been told that the system now in place ought to
resultina child such as Oskar being seen and assessed by a clinical eam. Lam
ied that the inteoduction of the Access and Advice Team, in the context of
the new Mindworks service, is intended o ensure that a referred child's needs are
properly identified and met

However, on the basis ofthe evidence I heard atthe prevention of future deaths
hearing, including from a special needs school which has experience of referring
its pupils, [am concerned that there isan ongoing risk that some referrals may be
inappropriately closed (for example because the child, atan early stage, declines
to engage) or inappropriately referred to non-clinical partner agencies. In this
‘context, Lam concerned that there isa lack of specific monitoring of what
‘proportion of referred children reach a clinical eam and the extent to which the
‘outcomes match the expectations ofthe referrers (so that any ongoing “barriers”
the system, which may be preventing proper access tothe clinical teams, can then
be identified and eliminated).

Concern3
‘The evidence showed that a referral to the child mental health services is wiaged
initially as being erisis, urgent, priority or routine. The criteria forcrisis, urgent
and priority referrals are specific and narrow and, consequently, the great majority
of referrals are categorised as routine. Ihave been told that the rout

are automatically categorised as “low risk”. Lam concerned about this a itis clear

referrals

From he evidence thata child may not meet he cvterla crisis, urgent or pron
Dut, like Oskar Nash, may nevertheless beata high or medium tisk of harm. The
‘Trusts currently receiving a high volume of referrals and so there isa
‘considerable waiting time for its “routine” cases to be addressed. It seems
inevitable, therefore, that there are children in this category who have been
wrongly assumed 0 be at low risk of harm but who, in fact, face a high risk of
‘harm which is currently unrecognised and unmanaged.

Concern
1 was told that the Standaed Operating Procedure manual forthe triage of referrals
1 children’s mental health servicesis to be updated to reflect the Trust's new
working practices but that this has not yet been done. Lam concerned that
important changes to the system of work (for example, the vital requirement that a
referred child's records are reviewed before any triaging decision is made and the
child/family are spoken to) are not yet established in writen guidance.

Concern
‘The evidence atthe inquest showed thatthe clinicians who were responsible for
ensuring that Oskar Nash’s medical conditions, including his risk of self-harm and
suicide, and his consequential needs, were properly and sufficiently recorded in
his Education, Health and Cate Plan, Failed to do so: this was in part because they
did not fully understand their role and obligations inthis regard,

‘On the basis of the evidence at the prevention of Future deaths heats
‘concerned that there continues to be a lack of underst

clinicians currently providing medical advice as part of the EHCP process as to
their role in that process. Iam further concerned that there is in place no
programme forthe taining or monitoring of these clinicians in relation t these

responsibilities.

B, Surrey County Council (and National)
(H Education and Special Educational Needs Department

Concern6
‘The evidence atthe inquest revealed that the staff in the Education /SEN
Department, including SEN c

Autism, its links to co-morbid mental health conditions, self-harm and suicidal
ideation, and how to communicate with an autistic child. 1am concerned that there
continues to be no requirement forthe staff to undertake relevant Autism training
‘on a mandatory basis.

Concern7
‘The evidence at the inquest showed that, in the months before his death, Oskar
Nash was moved froma special needs school and placed into a mainstream school
Which did not have the facilities or expertise sufficiently to meet his complex
needs. [found that the inappropriate placement, by SCC, of Oskarinto the

ream school contributed t his death,

Prior to the placement, the mainstream school had been provided with Oskar's
Educational, Health and Care Plan, but this Failed adequately o identify and
‘record his mental and emotional health concerns his tisk of suicidal ideation, his
consequential needs, and the provision required to meet those needs, and ithad
not been updated reflect a series of subsequent reviews of the Plan and
significant subsequent events. The mainstream school was not provided with any
of the extensive and informative records from the special needs school from which
he was being moved,

1 was told by the mainstream school that, had they seen the records held by bi
special needs school, they would have recognised their inability to meet his
‘and informed the SEN Department accordingly

weeds

At the prevention of future deaths hearing, I was told that it continues to be the
cease that a prospective school will usually be provided by the SEN Department
With the child's EHCP only. Further, it was apparent that there isa lack of elaity
aso the extent which a current school may or should provide records or
information to a prospective school

am concerned that there is an ongoing risk that placements of children with
EHCPs are being made on the basis of inadequate information and ecord sharing.
‘On the evidence before me, it was clear that, even if an EHCP were
‘comprehensive and fully updated (which may not be the ease), itis unlikely to
contain all matters of elevanceto the question of a prospective school's ability to
meet the child's needs.

was given no good reason why fuller information.
to ensure that the prospective school can properly as
child’s needs, should not take place before any child with an EHCP is placed in a
new school. Lam concerned that there is no system in place, locally or nationally,
to ensute this is achieved by the relevant SEN department for every child with an
EHCP. I am also concerned that there is an ongoing lack of clarity as to schools’
powers and duties o share information and documents, and any data protection
tamifications this may have.

(i) Children's Services Department

Concern
‘The evidence atthe inquest revealed that the stafFin SCC’s Children’s Services
Department, including Social Workers and other Team members, had insufficient
understanding of Autism. its Iinks to co-morbid mental health conditions, self-
harm and suicidal ideation, and howto communicate with an autistic child, Lam
‘concerned that there continues to be no requirement forthe staff to undertake
relevant Autism taining on a mandatory bass,

Concern
‘At the inquest I found that following Oskar Nash’s final referral to SCC’s
Children’s Services Department, which was made approximately two months
before his death, there Was a failure to appreciate the seriousness of hiss

‘and the risks arising, and a consequential failure to allocate his ease appropriately,
found that this contributed to his death. The inappropriate allocation esulted, in
par, from the application of SCC’s then “threshold of needs” document, which
was used to inform the level at which support should be provided.

ation

At the prevention of future deaths hearing, I heard evidence about SCC’s revised

Ineshold of needs” document, as well as the recent guidance (including a
‘oolbox”) in relation to suicidality, which has been introduced sinee Oskar’s
death

Despite these changes, Iemain concermed that the “threshold of needs” document
does not adequately and cleatly reflect the known tisks of mental health
Aifficultes, self-harm, and suividal ideation for autistic children (given theie
prevalence in this group of children) and that, consequentialy, theres an ongoing
tisk that an autistic child in these circumstances willbe allocated an insufficient
level of support, as was the ease for Oskar

. Surrey County Council and Surrey Heartlands Clinical
Commissioning Group (and National)

Concern 10
At the prevention of future deaths hearing, Iheard evidence concerning the post-
death reviews conducted into Oskar Nash’s death by the Susrey Child Death
Review Partnership Team and the Surrey Safeguatding Children Partnership. The
evidence showed that neither process resulted ina sufficient or effective
investigation of the death: [consider thatthe evidence shows that fat

Superficial, there was no meaningful analysis of the part played by statutory
‘agencies in the causation of his death, and only very limited learning was
identified,

the risk of further
al

Ineffective review by the child death review processes results
deaths in similar circumstances and Lam concerned that the local and/or
process, guidance and oversight are insufficient to ensure that an effective post-
death investigation, which should not be dependent on the inquest provess, is
achieved in all eases,

D. National Issues

Concern 11
From the evidence I heaed atthe inquest and the prevention of future deaths
hearing, it was apparent that the national “Working Together” guidance focuses
‘on children who are in need of safeguarding by reason of risks within the home or
From other parental failures to keep the child safe, It was apparent that the
‘consequential approach tends fo ook critically atthe child’s family and parent(s)
‘and their parenting skills, and that this is likely to be inappropriate if the child isin
need through disability. I consider that this had a detrimental impact on the
‘approach of agencies to Oskar and his family

am concemed that“Working Together” does not provide clearer guidance
specifically forthe safeguarding of children with disabilities, including Autism,
‘and the approach to be taken by agencies to parents and families.

Concern 12
‘The evidence at the inquest revealed a widespread lack of knowledge and
understanding of Autism, its links to co-morbid mental health conditions, self-
harm and suicidal ideation, and howto communicate with an autistic ehild. There
was a lack of training across all the state agencies from which Uheatd. Atte
prevention of future deaths hearing, [heard evidence of more training being
available, but also of an ongoing absence of comprehensive, relevant and
mandatory training.

1 was told that the National Autism Strategy does not currently include a
timetabled commitment for relevant mandatory Autism training to be provided to
all state agencies working ditectly with autistic adults and childses

Tam concemed that this poses an ongoing tsk to autistic children and their ability
twaccess the services they require for their support, welfare, and safeguarding

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

‘The Deceased, who had been diagnosed with anxiety and prescribed medication
accordingly, took his own life in his student accommodation on 8 October 2020. At
the time of his death he had recently commenced his studies at The University of
Manchester.

‘As part of his application process for his tertiary level education, the Deceased
applied through the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) online
system. As part of the UCAS application form, an applicant is asked to confirm
whether they have any ‘disabiliy’ or ‘special needs’. The Deceased, using the drop-
down list, confirmed he had no disabilty

‘The Deceased did in fact have a diagnosed mental health illness. The guidance
notes for completion of the UCAS form make reference to ‘mental health’; however,
such notes are not commonly accessed by applicants, and reference to ‘mental

Teallh’ as a dsabilly can be confusing and discouraging for applicants.

CORONEF

CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to
concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is
taken. In the circumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

‘The option for applicants to disclose @ mental health ilness should be considered
separate to them confirming whether they have any ‘dsablity' or ‘special needs’. It's
likely that the majorty of applicants will consider evidence of a disability or special
needs to refer to physical lness, not mental health ilness. Moreover, those who
suffer from mental health ilness (irrespective of is severity) will often not consider
themselves to have a ‘disability

Omitting to refer specifically (and explicity) to mental health on the form could, in my
judgement, discourage applicants from disclosing information about their mental
health diagnosis, and thus provide them with support at the point they commence
their studies.

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

4 est august 2021 Nr Daron Busby was at home wih his omy, He
MBI 2 or isto, Pr to hs death Mr Busby haa compl
jeadaches an

tad been referred for an MRI scan of his head. He had had the MRI scan in
‘April 2021. It emerged in the course of my investigation that the outcome of that MRI scan
‘was never reviewed by a clinician. | did not conclude that this was causative of, or related
to, Mr Busby's death. However, the circumstances in which it was not reviewed give me
cause for concern that there is a risk of future deaths unless action is taken.

CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concer. In my
pinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the
circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

‘After it became apparent that the result of Mr Busby’s MRI scan had not been reviewed by a
clinician, a consultant employed by North Cumbria Integrated Care NHS Foundation Trust
(the Trust’) undertook an investigation. He noted that the Trust use EMIS as an electronic
patient record. He explained that the Trust used a separate system called ICE to gather the
results of tests or scans. ICE is capable of linking to EMIS to input results into the EMIS
system. Once a test result has been linked to a patient in EMIS the result enters the EMIS
record as a provisional result pending review, and is placed on a work list. The consultant or
a deputy then reviews the result, files it with or without comment and records any actions
taken. EMIS provides two options: file no comment’ and file and comment. Results of blood
tests which are undertaken to monitor treatment and which are normal may be filed without
comment. If there is an abnormality flagged, however, EMIS will default to the file with
comment dialogue box even if fle no comment is selected. This acts as a safeguard against
missing a significant finding. Unfortunately, there is no flag attached in the ICE system for
abnormal radiology results, and so no failsafe exists for defaulting to a file and comment’ if
a significant positive or negative finding is reported,

In the course of investigating what occurred in relation to Mr Busby's MRI scan, it was
determined that clicking more than once on the ‘fle no comment’ button will result in the
displayed result being filed, but wil also result in fling of the next in the lst f that result has
no flag indicating the result is abnormal. Thus if a radiology result ies below a normal blood
result and a clinician inadvertently double clicks to file the first result, the radiology result is
also filed without comment and without the result being displayed. Furthermore, multiple
clicks up to 6 (and perhaps even beyond) will lead to multe flings. In the result it is
possible that a clinician inadvertently clicking ‘file no comment’ more than once on one
result would cause results which require urgent folow up being filed without a clinician being
involved.

| am concerned that this might lead to lost opportunities to treat patients whose scans
reveal, for instance, early malignancies. It might also mean that scans which reveal the
need for urgent action will be overlooked. | am therefore concerned that future deaths will

| was impressed by the candour of the report provided to me and the efforts that the Trust
have already taken to resolve this issue. However | noted that the evidence | received was
that ""In order to fix this issue it is likely it will require action by the publishers of EMIS to
prevent accidental fling of results. To attempt to mitigate this issue whilst a permanent fix is
sought | have worked with colleagues from Pathology and Radiology to attempt to have all
radiology results (where the greatest risk lies) flagged within the ICE system as abnormal,
so that any attempt to file the result prompts via the file and comment dialogue box
Unfortunately at the time of writing this letter the flag, which is triggered in ICE for any
radiology report originating within Cumbria Neuroscience, does not carry through to EMIS
and we continue to seek a local solution to mitigate this newly identified risk.”

In the circumstances | have concluded that itis necessary for action to be taken to prevent
future deaths.

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and | believe you (1) North,
‘Cumbria Integrated Care NHS Foundation Trust and (2) EMIS Group have the power to
take such action.

‘number of drugs in lan’s blood and urine that he had not been prescribed.

‘The court was informed that at HMP Usk, all prisoners are required to be
capable of managing their own medication. The medications are not kept in 9
locked facility. The evidence provided clearly indicated that prisoners were
trading prescribed medication which had become a form of currency within
the prison. lan’s former cellmate indicated this practice was rife and indeed lan
bought medication from other prisoners. Evidence was heard from the
Governor / Head of Safety at HMP Usk who informed the court that he was not
‘aware of this practice, and It appears this was also not known by the prison
officers.

‘The court was informed that there isa system of randomised checks in place
‘within the prison to attempt to determine whether prisoners are appropriately
‘managing their medication, however prisoners have clearly found ways around
this.

Whilst the ingestion of unprescribed medication did not contribute to lan's
death, this practice, if left unchecked, clearly puts the lives of other prisoners

7 [INQUEST
On 12° September 2019, an inquest was opened into the death of Matk Caste,
(aka Mark Marshall) who died on 26"" June 2019 in St Thomas Hospital
MER 11 0s¢ as concluded on 8"" Dever!
A jry concluded that he died by suicide, by EE
[ERB hich lel co his death. It was contributed by non completion of
2 tc rik form by probation officer for court staff and non confiscation by the
dock officer of his III which he brought into the dock impermissibly

7 | CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

‘The probation officer who assessed him when he was on ail, 6 days before his lst
appearance in court knew that he had a natciccstic personality disorder with a
history of impulsiveself harm. Indeed he had I casing 3
stroke in front of police when they sought eo enter his house to arrest him in

2016.

She wrote in the OASYS report that his risk of suicide was greatest when police
are attempringto arrest him, She did not anticipate that an act of self harm might
be repeated when he surrendered bail for sentencing, but acknowledged in
retrospect that she would in future consider ita risk. Even if she had she would
rot have filled out a suicide risk form to notify oure staff as she did not consider
there was an immediate risk, This appes
the NPS Guide to staff Working with Suicide, where the trigger fora stategy to

to have been based on Appendix | of

prevent suicide is ifthe answer to the question Istheve an inmadiat rs of suicide? is
affirmative. In courrshe thought perhaps 50% of offenders have suicidal thoughts,
burt said only about oncea month she filled in a suicide isk notification form. She
dlenied she had too high a threshold for assessing imminent risk,

ler manager did nor consider that the length of sentence would bea surprise ro
the deceased and informed the cour chat if the threshold for completing a form
was lower, it would catch almost all clients and not enab

any priogty action, S
said chat there was nothing in NPS records to indicate the officer should ave
generated a suicide risk form on 23M April and that her decision was entirely
reasonable and did not consider there was an opportunity to prevent his death as
itwas not foreseeable.

‘The manager advised that there would ctwoen officers as to what was
referred but the policy was not too prescriptive to avoid missing some risks. The

jury concluded otherwise, identifying the policyas requiring imminence of risk.

‘The dock officer did not know of his pas history of impulsive self harm, nor
considered there was any rsk of self harm or reason to

HBB (i sso evident from that this was a meticulously planned suicide

with no indication of intent being disclosed, but fom the suicide note, in part
related to is having just received another custodial sentence: ""if die(as)! won t
verbein custody again

""THE CORONER'S MATTER OF CONCERN

‘The evidence suggests that his risks of recurrent impulsive self harm in situations
his ex wife described as “when he is cornered” were not fullyassessed as applying
to the timeatter he was being sentenced and if they had been, a notification form
might have been completed. Whether this was due tothe policy requiring

imminence of risk atthe time of assement or heing erroneously interpreted so, oF

whether the projection of imminence arising in a future context was not fully

considered, is not clear.

[ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent fature deaths. Whilst the precise
circumstances ofthis death were unique and unpredictable, there is a need for
public reassurance thae the projected contextutal self harm risks of those with
personality disorders are recognised and mitigated, especially for those receiving
less intensive assessment as they are on bail and not in custo.

(On 28 November 2018 I commenced an investigation into the death of
Frances Rose Thomas On the 10"" October 2021 I concluded the
Investigation. The medical cause of death given was:

1a, Suspension

I returned a conclusion of I) with Frankie's death more than
aminimally contributed to by the failures of:

1. Stepping Stone School:

4. To provide an effective -securty system as tasked to do so by
the department of Education,

b. Tocnsure Frankie's use ofthe iPad was monitored to confirm
her I saety

 Toprovide Frankie with supervision when not attending
lessons despite having an Educational Health Care Plan in
place

a. Alack of robustne:

inappropriate iifeontent that allowed Frankie to read
stories on ther platform on the day of her death featuring

anact
which she goes on to complete herself

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Frances Rose Thomas (Frankie) was a vulnerable teenager with a number
of significant underlying difficulties including childhood trauma, high
functioning autism, oppositional behaviour and impulsivity

‘Stepping Stones School is a school for students with moderate physical or
learning difficulties. Frankie was offered a place in year 8 and started in.
April 2016 with an Educational Care Plan in place. Throughout her time
at the school Frankie often refused to attend lessons and at the time of her
death rarely attended more than one lesson a week. When not attending,
lessons, she was left on her own without any formal supervision. During,
this time, she had access to a school computer and an iPad.

During the Inquest I heard evidence Frankie only had access to the
HI using schoo! time using electronic devices supplied by the
school. There was an e-security system in place for school computers but
it was not monitored by nominated safeguarding leads. This allowed
Frankie (as it did forall students) to freely access the IMJ without any
‘observation as to what websites were being accessed and for an
assessment to be made of their appropriateness. Furthermore, the iPads
had no e-security system in place at all, again allowing Frankie to freely

access the(§I without any supervision

(On the day of her death, Frankie was found to have accessed|

The stories that Frankie accessed on this platform featured

‘After school Frankie
went home and undertakes a similar act resulting in her death on 25!
September 2018

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

1 heard evidence that the Department of Education have devolved
responsibility for e-security systems with schools having to
‘tender’ for web filtering software and hardware. However, the
guidelines issued by the Department of Education require
updating and are insufficiently robust to ensure their effectiveness
and meet the changing demands of I e-security in schools

There is a wide range of software vendors providing different lists
of blocklists with different vendors enabling different categories
with no oversight or regulatory guidance by the Department of
Education as to what ‘blocklists’ are either acceptable and/or
suitable for a school environment.

HERE s 2012 specifically blocked J and not only can it be

Farhermore, Ihe it inadequate independent scrutiny by
HHMI © remove age inappropriate stories put on. their
porn

Some websites are only blocked when there is a particular key
word in the URL Ifthe relevant trigger word 5,
HB is 10 there it makes it difficult forthe filter to ‘see the
content of the website to be able to block it, hence why stories on

could be read. However, there are software systems
available that ats as a ‘key logger’ and ‘screen reader’. Whilst this
will not block the site it will generate a report to the nominated
safeguarding, individual for further action. Yet it has not been
considered or is part of the guidelines issued by the Department of
Education

In summary, on the evidence I heard there appears to be
inadequate regulatory oversight with now outdated guidance
issued by the Department of Education with regard to robust
standards of e-security systems within schools.

ii, Multi-Disciptinary Team meetings are held every 2 weeks at RM
Poole, where service personnel who are under the care of the
DCM and/or Welfare Team are discussed. There is also the
‘option for individual Case Conferences to be called on an ad hoc
basis to discuss an individual service user if the need arises.
Attendees at these meetings include the RSM and/or the
‘Adjutant, OCMH and the Welfare Team. The evidence I heard is

| that although Welfare Officers are trained to assess the risk

service user may pose to him or herself, in the MDT/Case

Conference setting the assessment as tothe nature ofthe risk an

| individual service user poses, and therefore the isk plan that is

formulated to mitigate those risks, is determined only by the view
taken by the DCMH. Where a service user may be providing
different information to DCMH and Welfare, the true extent ofthe
risk @ service user poses to him or herself may not be adequately
addressed in the formulation ofthe risk management plan.

li, There is no single composite risk assessment and care plan for

LI Senice users tat crews together al the relevant information for |

""a service user and identifies the plan in place (care plan and risk
management plan) at any given time. Such as document is often
sed in other care settings, including mental health trusts.

2. Thave concerns with regard to the following:

|. The lack of independence of DCMH risks service users minimising
and/or under reporting the risks they may pose to themselves for
fear that information may be disclosed to the Chain of Command.
If the true extent of the risk off is not known by DCMH, an
effective risk management plan to mitigate the risk of II
cannot be formulated,

li, The primacy of the view of DCMH when considering the risk of
in MDT/Case Conferences again means that the true risk
may not be accounted for, particulary where 2 service
user 15 providing different information to DCMH and Wetfare
‘and/or where there is a disagreement between DCMH and
Welfare as to the presenting level of risk. Adopting process
similar to a Multi-Agency Risk Management Meeting CMARM”) or
Muti Agency Risk Assessment Conference (*MARAC?) in 2 civilan
context may assist: in a MARM or MARAC, the level of risk
adopted is the highest level raised in the meeting/conference,
without any agency having primacy. Therefore, the risk
‘management plan subsequently formulated addresses the
highest level of rsk brought tothe meeting.

li, Where there is no composite risk assessment and care pian
document that draws together all the relevant information for a
Patient and identifies the plan in place at any given time, there is
2 risk that key information and risk factors are missed, which Is
less likely if there is 2 composite document in addition to the
clinical records.

‘ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I
believe you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action.

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH
Inbox 3of the Record of inquest for Marshal, | recorded as follows:

Marshall Metcalfe was known to mental health services. He had twice been admitted to a
Tier 4 (inpatient) Child & Adolescent Mental Heath facility , most recently in February 2019
after an apparent relapse of his iliness, complicated by physical heath difficulties that had

‘required a hospital admission. He had been diagnosed as suffering from psychosis. Marshall
\was known to be someone who would refuse to engage in almost any social interaction. He
was discharged on 06/01/20 and he returned to reside with his Mother. This was a decision
‘early made withthe support of Marshall and his Mother. By the time he was discharged
‘minimal progress had been made and his lack of engagement persisted. An alternative
placement was not considered, largely because of his desire to return home and to 2
‘supportive family. Children’s social care were unable to contribute to discharge planning
having not been notified about Marshall's discharge for approximately two months
afterwards. No sk assessment had been completed. Following discharge, Marshall
continued to take his prescribed Clozapine medication. Over subsequent weeks his
presentation remained stable although his weight did noticeably increase which isa known
side effect ofthat medication. Following discharge, he was not seen by a community
psychiatrist at a planned review on 19/03/20 asa result of coronavirus restrictions in place at
that time. At around 12 noon on 07/05/20 he was seen to eave hore,

‘Marshall was
transferred by ambulance tothe Royal Preston Hospital but had received catastrophic
Injuries and his death was verified at 14:33 hours that afternoon.

In box 3 ofthe Record of Inquest for Jane, | recorded a follows:

Jane ireland was known to have had a history of mental health issues, although in recent
years she had been largely stable, and save for a relapse in early 2018 when she had stopped
{aking her medication and in December 2019 when she went to see her own GP and was
referred to START, she experienced no major relapses or acute episodes. On 7th May 2020,
Jane's seventeen year old Son died. Having been seen at her home address on 6"" June 2020
when she is reported to have been in good spirits, Jane was found deceased in her bed by 3
friend at her home address on 07/06/2020. A paramedic attended and verified her death at
16:00 hours. A subsequent post mortem examination revealed that Jane had, during the
hours prior to her death,

the tone effects of which, in combination with faty liver disease,
proved fatal. Her death was more than minimally contributed to by bronchopneumonia
Identified at post mortem. From the available evidence it cannot be established whether Jane
intended to end her ite.

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS
During the course ofthe inquests, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my
opinion there Isa rsk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. inthe
circumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows,

This report relates to two inquests. They were held jointly after | acceded to a request from the
bereaved family that the inquests be conducted together.

‘As willhave been noted from section & above, both Marshall Metcalfe and his Mother, Jane
Ireland, were known to mental health services. The concern | wish to raise emaneted from
‘Marshal's death, He had been admitted toa mental health faci in February 2019 and

remained there until he was discharged on 06/01/20 to his Mother's home where he resided
Until his death on 07/05/20. One month later, his Mother Jane died at her home on
07/06/2020.
The court heard that when Marshall was in the mentalheath feclty during what was his 2%
‘admission, a decision was made to discharge him trom children’s social care. He had been
supported asa Chill in Need [under section 17, Children Act 1989] for 28 months, and this
continued fora large part ofthat admission unt 14/10/18. In September 2019, a decision had
been taken by Children’s Social Care to cease their Involvement as no role could be identified
fora statutory socal worker at that time. Any home leave had been suspended indefinitely,
‘and there were no definite plans for Marshall tobe discharged, However, a request was made
‘that inthe event the decision about home leave were to change, of discharge was to be
considered tkely for Marshall, then Chidren’s Social Care would again havea role and are

| referral should be made.

‘n fact, Marshall was discharged on 06/01/20, there being no evidence before the court that
such 2re-referrl had infact been received by Children’s Social Care by then andi follows
there had been no social worker input into Marshall's discharge planning,

At the inquest, the court received evidence {from Marshal's Responsible Clinician, Consultant.
Child & Adolescent Psychiatrst, Dr INI) that in his experience when patients are
‘admitted tothe facility Children’s Socal Care wil close thele case forthe patent, and that when
‘the patients later ready for discharge a rexeferal becomes necessary. He also reminded the
‘court that throughout a patient's admission, consideration i being given to discharge in ine
with the recommendation of NHS England that all admissions should be kept as short as
possible andthe expectation that there should be discussion about discharge at every Care
Programme Approach (CPA) meeting

Another witness, III. a former inpatient Social Worker atthe facility with 25,
years of experience 2s an Approved Mental Health Professional, told the court that in his view
when such arereferal does become necessary its like “starting from scratch” and causes
immense problems building trusting therapeutic relationships with young people. He felt that
there should be continual input from social care during the patient's admission, and that inthe
{event that there has been no social worker input into 2 patients discharge this raises the risk
for that person once they leave the fact.

|also instructed O(N. 2 Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist, to provide an
independent expert opinion on the care provided to Marshall. Inher evidence she shared the
concems of Or II 27d II) 2nd described this as“a wider issue"" that was not
confined to this case

The issue that I raise as follows: share I concern, echoed by Dr NI, and ideally
social care not closing ther case, but remaining involved throughout a patient's admission
would be helpful. t may be that they would play 2 minor role, if any, whist the patient remains
‘in hospital until cicharge isflt to be a genuine prospect, but once their Input does become
necessary they would be more able to respond quickly and to actively participate in discharge
planning without the need to wait forthe re-referral process to be carried out, thereby
ensuring that the effectiveness of role played by social care in discharge planning isnot
compromised

ln Marshall's case, I found that there was no evidence that shortcomings in relation to
discharge had materiaty contributed to his death but fee that ths isue does pose arsk of
{deaths inthe futuee, and that ti my duty to write this report.

‘Saif was managed inthe AICU from 4°10 7° June. On the 7"" June, he was transfered
from AICU to NICU. He had various fusions runing, including @ Heparin irfusion. At
the time of Iransler he was prescribed a dose rate of 4 mUhour. Sal was also.on

Whilst the prescribed doses remained the same, he was in fact administered adose
‘almost 8 times higher than that, namely 8.3 ml shou. itseams ikely tal the rate
prescribed for the phosphate infusion as mistakenly applied to Heparin.

‘This matter has been investigated, andthe rusthas produced an excelent report. The
‘evidence heard atthe inquest, and within that report, show that

1. Nurses working in a NICU do not routinely use anticoagulant medication. The
purses who stated the wong Heparin rate were not familar with usual dosage

4. Tho systoms in place atthe time allow for the prescription rate and
administration rte io be markedly diferent without that being lagged up.

5. Crucially, the hospital uses diferent computer systems in diferent pats ofthe

diagnosed as a severe depressive illness.

Dr Dixon was admitted to the Priory Hospital, Altrincham as an informal,

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise
to concem. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur
Unless action is taken. In the circumstances itis my statutory duty to
report to you.

‘The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows. —

‘The Court heard it was likely that an observation chart, designed to
record regular observations, had been pre-populated by a staff member
to show when observations were intended to be taken as opposed to
recording when they actually took place.

‘Additionally, the Court heard that the automatic timings generated by the
‘electronic care record system in use at the Priory could be over-written
manually, thus leading to inaccurate times being recorded in the records.
‘The following concems arise from the above:

|
1. Given the particular importance of documented observations being
taken at specific intervals on mental health wards, itis a matter of,

‘concer that standardised observation charts (logether with

‘accompanying standard rules as to how they should be completed) are
Tot in use across these settings both in the NHS and private sectors;

2. Forsimilar reasons, itis a matter of concer that automatic time
‘stamps generated by electronic care records systems can be overwritten
by users without the corresponding record showing clearly that this has
happened, whist also recording of the actual time an entry has been
made.

3.__Itis a matter of concem that, where record keeping on a ward is
Undertaken by unregistered staff such as Nursing Assistants and
Healthcare Assistants, such individuals are not subject to professional

Tequirements in respect of documentation, such as those which exist for
doctors and nurses.

The coroner expressed concern about the lengthy delays for students to access mental health support services and recommended providing prompt counseling support for vulnerable students and not relying solely on antidepressant prescriptions. The university has since recruited more mental health advisors and reduced waiting times for support.",Unspecified or Complex Cases,Mental Health Services and Crisis Management ; Healthcare Coordination and Continuity ; Risk Assessment and Suicide Prevention,Education and Academic Institutions

‘CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS:

| make tis report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and
regulations 28 and 29 ofthe Coraners (Investigations) Regulations 2013

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(0n 14/07/2020 | commenced an investigation into the death of Mared Thomas Foukes, 21 . The
investigation concluded at he end ofthe inquest on 28 October 2021. The conclusion ofthe
inquest was Suicide.

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH
‘Mared Thomas Foukes, aged 21, died beneath the Britannia Bridge on 8 July 2020. Mared was
a student at the School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at Cardlf University studying
foraM Pharm. She had received examination results the morning she ied indicating tha she
had ‘not successtuly completed this yearstage of her programme of study. Itwas revealed
ater her death tha she had successilly completed the year (once the ralficaion process had
‘eeured)

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters ging ie to concer. In my
opinion there isa risk that fture deaths wil occur unless action i taken. Inthe circumstances it
Is my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are 2s follows. —

(1), The sharing of examination results and how examinations are marked is complex, confusing
And at times capable of appearing misleading. Mared had faied one Professional Skls,
‘Assessment during the second year of her degree (201812020) and had undertaken a rest
uring the fist semester for which she had received a ‘provisional pass’. This was not ratified in
the June exam board: instead it wae fo be raed inthe September exam board round in
accordance withthe Universit pocy though that was net obviously clear alte time). The
Indiation therefore o Mared in Jly 2020 was that she had not successtully completed the year.
‘The result was later raed in September. Furthermore, marks of 39% and 19% (fal) for
assessments are given in situations where marks could be pending!

(2) There is no system in place fr personal tutors o contact students ahead of the release of
faled examination results, especially in vulnerable students. Students are not contacted directly
by telephone by ther personal tutors ahead ofthe release of the results inthe event of faled
‘modules or inthe event of being informed that they had no! successtuly completed tha year
despite the complex and confusing assessment and results process and potentially misleading
process around the sharing of examination results

‘ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action shouldbe taken to provent future deaths and I belove you, Cari
University, ave the power to take such action.

(a) Ratiyng examination results at the fst available opportunity. 2. June, where a student
has a provisional pass folowing successtul rest for an intial faled Professional Skill
‘Assessment (or equivalent in oher schools or coleges)

(b) Amending wording on exam notification correspondence to students (ranscripts, emails,
fe) fo include ‘pending’ results, clarifying which exam board round (June or Sepicmber)
wil ray the results and clarty on assessment and ratification processes.

(6) Provide addtional and ongoing training to schoal staf! onthe cary of explanation to
students of assesement processes,

(¢) Provide further addtional supporto students where they are to receive a ‘ai

",790,"1. The decision to rescind the section was made by a clinician who had been in the role for only two weeks, without involvement or awareness of the family and without a proper assessment of the patient's mental capacity or an updated care plan.
2. Treatment in the Newsam Centre lacked continuity, with a locum clinician taking over from another locum psychiatrist, no ward manager for leadership, and incomplete nursing records possibly due to issues with the electronic recording system.
3. After becoming a voluntary patient, various factors should have triggered a reconsideration of the decision, including Mr. Bastock leaving the ward without evaluation, family members expressing concern, and the possibility of a farewell gesture being overlooked.
4. Despite indicating he felt unable to live alone and a social work assessment taking place, no plan for alternative accommodation was in place, making it premature to consider discharge.
5. When Mr. Bastock left the ward, there was a failure to notify the police as a missing person, given his suicide risk.","Nel Peter Bastock, who had a history of paranoid schizophrenia and suicidal tendencies, died while under voluntary care at the Newsam Centre.

17-00 hours he reported erroneously that he had been sentenced to five years

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN areas follows: —

(1) Mr Franks had 8 known history of self-harming and suicide attempts. His
‘emotional state when seen at court on 11 Apri 2019 was triggered at last in
part to his reaction to @ development in the prosecution brought against hie
‘which he had not foreseen, Hi statement that he was likely to commit suicide
was not communicated to ether the secu staff atthe court or the prison stat
In consequence, the prison staff had no information concerning the events
which took place at court.

(2) Me Franks somehow perceived that he had been sentenced to five years
Imprisonment, which wes not the case, Ths falso impression caused hin to be
in distress prior to being locked in his col around 18:00 hours.

(@) Had information conceming his emotions at court been relayed to the prison
staff, this may have Wriggered a decision to open an ACCT ~ the process by
which a prisoner is subject fo increased monitoring and support. Inthe event no

‘hacks were made on him for some TO hous.

(4) Ata previous hearing on 25.02.17 Mr Franks had made a comparable threat to
Kil himself as a result of what he perceived to be an adverse development in the
case brought against him. At that time his signed consent’ authoring
information to be passed to the prison was obtained and communicated to the
prison

(5) The benef of relaying helpful information tothe prison Intended to protect Mr
Franks, does not seem to involve a breach of professional privlege. It would
hhave boon suffent to request that the prison staff assess Mr Franks for
themselves on his return in view of (unspectied) developments at court that
ay.

regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013.

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(On the 09/09/20 | commenced an investigation into the death of Darren John Lawrence. The

investigation concluded on the 4"" October 2021

The Conclusion of the inquest was

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Mr. Lawrence had a tistory of ilicit drug use and first presented to mental health services in
June 2018 after having EE and was expressing delusional beliefs. He
‘was detained under S.136 of the MHA. During his mental heaith assessment in hospital he
then denied thoughts of suicide or seltharm. In May of 2019 he attended ARE after taking a
NS 29 #22 2100 of ening his own lite. He
‘was detained for a short period of time under S.5(2) of the MHA. It was intially considered
safe for him to be discharged home, but after further presentations he was detained under
‘S.2 of the MHA later that month. During the course ofthis admission he exhibited some
symptoms of psychosis but subsequently became an informal patient and was taking leave
from the ward to visit his home and see family members.

He was discharged trom hospital in June 2019 with initial support from the Home Based
Treatment Team (HBTT) which resulted in him being under theie care from the 26"" June to
the 5° July 2019 but had been referred to the Community Mental Health Team (CMHT) for
longer term support. The HBTT is a service designed to give more intensive support for
patients being treated in the community ands often an alternative to inpatient care. On the
16"" August 2019 a joint HBT and CMHT visit to see him took place. He seamed to be
compliant with his medication and attended several out patient appointments, but he was
suffering rom increased anxiety. His prescription of Mirtazapine was increased on the 3°
October 2018. The HBTT is a service designed to provide intensive supporto pationts in the
‘community and is often an alternative to inpatient care.

He then failed to attend further appointments in November and December 2019 and one on
the Sth January 2020 after which his ""partner"" noted the CMHT of a deterioration in his
‘mood. On the 7"" February 2020 an unannounced visit was made to his home and he voiced
suicidal thoughts and plans and appeared depressed but was unwiling to become a
Voluntary patient in hospital. Concems about his general welfare were identified and a
referral made to HBTT.

(On the 11"" February 2020 he disclosed that he was still experiencing suicidal thoughts and
struggled to find ways of distracting himself trom them. The same day a CMHT STS doctor
Wrote a detailed 5 page ler to his GP Practice informing them of the treatment plan
including ‘start Venlafaxine 37.5 mg BD. The GP to continue prescribing Mitazapine.” This
letter was received by the GP Practice on an unknown date but was scanned into the GP
Electronic records on the 9"" April 2020. However, the GP did not see it or have it brought to
their attention

On the 17° February a CT2 HBTT doctor wrote to his GP Practice with a very shot 3 line
letter asking that them to take over the responsibilty for prescribing the Venlafaxine. This
letter was added tothe GP records system on the 19"" February 2020 and seen by the GP
the folowing day. He requested his staff to arrange a phone appointment witn the deceased
because he wanted to raview his mental health and discuss the leer with the deceased
before the prescription was issued. In adaition to check what other medication he was taking
and answer any queries. The GP was sill unaware of the existence or content ofthe letter of
the 11"" February,

(On the 26” February the deceased refused entry to his home when a joint visit was made by
‘members of both the CMHT and HBTT. The plan was then to transfer his care from the
(CMT to the HBTT.

(On the 2nd March 2020 the HBTT Consultant Psychiatrist wrote to the GP Practice
summarising the recent medical history ingicatig that the Venlafaxine dose is increased to
""225 mg mane, prescribed by HBT. Darren was discharged trom HBT back to the care of
CMT. GP to take over prescribing from 10/3/20."" Whilst the GP received the

Correspondence, it was not added to the computer record system until the 30"" March 2020,
and on the same day a Locum GP requested that it was sent fo the Pharmacist. The GP did
‘ot prescribe venlafaxine as was requested and was still unaware of the existence and.
Content ofthe letter of the 11™ February 2020.

© The GP attompted to contact the deceased by phone on the 10"" April 2020, but this was
Unsuccessful. A Text message was sent to the deceased requesting that he contact the GP
but there was no response. On the 30” April 2020 an unknown member of staf recorded
that no action was required

Consequently, the deceased was never prescribed Venlafaxine and did not receive the
therapeutic benefit that the medication could provide. CMHT did not check whether this
‘medication was actually being prescribed and collected by the deceased.

(On the 5* May 2020 his ""partner"" reported that there appeared to be no changes in his
presentation despite the medication. No one in the HBT or CMHT were aware that his
elation ship with his ‘partner’ had broken down 18 months before. Consequently, she was
his “ex-partner’. No direct contact was successfully made with the deceased thereafter. On
the 3 June 2020 a person described as his sister-in-law raised concerns with the contact,
Centre regarding his welfare and escribes how he is not taking his medication and is
currently unwell, This was referred to CMHT and a worker was assigned on the 11"" June
2020 contact him by phone, but this was not attempted until the 25” June 2020.

(On the 24” July 2020 the GP Practice Pharmacist questioned the deceased's compliance
with medication. No action was taken as a consequence and neither the GP Practice, HBTT
‘or CMHT communicated with one ancther to recognise the true position,

The deceased's ex-partner was asked to monitor him and report any concems, but she was
‘noted to have moved out of the home on the 19"" August to stay with relatives and also that
he was not doing well and there were long term housing and relationship problems. Their
lifestyle was chaotic. No further contact was made with him and on the 28 August,

found dead at his home address ater a.

Itis well recognised in psychiatric practice that a patient withthe history of disengagement
With services and who does not take his medication that will probably lead to a deterioration
in their mental health and increase the rsk of seltharm or suicide.

‘(CORONER'S CONCERNS
During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my
pinion there isa risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the
circumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN aro as follows:

1

‘The transfer and communication process from the HBTT to the CMHT in 2019 and 2020
was unsatisfactory with inadequate follow up as required. The court has received evidence
about similar problems in other inquests in which GMMH was the treating NHS Trust and is
a repeated issue of concern.

b. There was lack of appropriate escalation folowing the deceased's disengagement with
‘community services in 2019 but also in 2020 when there was a repeated lack of direct
Contact with im as well as the recognition of its importance. Fram June 2020 no other
‘methods wore tried to have direct contact with the deceased apart from attempts trom phone
calls which were repeatedly unsuccessful

c. There was no consideration of referral back to the HBTT by the CMHT when the
deceased may have benefited from it when circumstances changed. There was
cisengagement from services after the end of February 2020 as well as evidence of
‘noncompliance with medication.

4d. There was no GMMH procedure or process to check regulary if the deceased was being
prescribed the correct medication and it being collected. In addition his response to it.

©. The GP practice failed to ensure that medication (fora patient witha serious mental
health problem witha history of suicidal ideas, plans and previous attempts) was prescribed,
This is despite them receiving letters from GMNIH clinicians requesting this. Consequently,
the deceased did not receive the therapeutic benefit the medication would have provided

f. The GP system for recording receipt of correspondence and ensuring that they were seen.
and reviewed by a GP was inadequate. As was communication with and from the Pharmacy
team. Nor was there consideration of a system or process for contacting the secondary care
provider GMMH in such circumstances when medication was not prescribed as requested
‘and no contact could be made with the deceased. There was no escalation
processiprocedure.

19. There was no CMHT/HBTT planned involvement with the GP in the overall management
And treatment ofthe deceased apart trom simply requesting that they issue repeat
prescriptions. This meant that opportunities to develop other lines of communication and
Information sharing as well as support wore lost.

h. The CMHT Responsible Clinician was an important witness but the GMMH SUI
investigation aid not obtain a statement from him and the those carrying out the investigation
falled to recognise the significance af this. Nor was ths identified in the overview of the
report before it was signed off. This meant the all the lessons for future care and planning
were not learnt. The court has received evidence about the same issue in ather inquests
involving deaths of GMMH patients and is a repeated matter of concer

",1283,"1. The contingent instruction regarding absconding placed too much emphasis on the patient's ability to manage her own emotions, compromising her safety.
2. The decision to permit ground leave shortly after an incident without proper documentation or consideration of the patient's history of absconding was made on a relatively informal basis.
3. The instructions regarding physical interventions to restrain the patient were not defined or specified clearly, leading to confusion among staff.
4. The permission given for the patient to walk in the hospital grounds did not consider important factors such as the need for two escorts and reviewing the type of medication applied to her wounds.
5. The care plan containing the instruction not to restrain or follow the patient was discussed and agreed upon, giving her knowledge of a period of grace before the police would be notified of her absconding.
6. The type of medication used at the Becklin Centre should be reconsidered to prevent it from being used as a means of self-harm.
7. The general policy in relation to absconding patients has been under review but has been delayed, posing an ongoing risk of future deaths.
8. Action should be taken to prevent future deaths, and the organization is expected to respond with details of the action taken or proposed.
9. The Chief Coroner may publish a complete, redacted, or summary form of the report and send it to relevant parties.","Alexandra Jane Tolley, a 20-year-old who was compulsorily detained in a psychiatric hospital, died from a hypoxic brain injury after absconding from the hospital grounds and being found in cardiac arrest the following day.

‘The conclusion ofthe inquest was

1a Suspension

‘The jury reached the folowing conclusions:

Mr Cope voluntarily committed suicide which ended his if, We feel that he performed
this act whist conscious of what he was doing, and he intended to end his life.

\We do not consider theres enough evidence to suggest the closure ofthe ACCT on
(04/09/2019 directly contributed to Mr Cope's death. Similarly, we consider a lack of
Information sharing between the health, mental health, care staff did not contribute to
Mr Cope's death staff were adequately trained to support Mr Cope and the response,
by staff to Mr Cope's assault was appropriate and didnot contribute to his death, The
degree of risk of suicide identified in the risk assessment was documented and
understood based on what Mr Cope communicated atthe time.

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

‘Me Cope ded on 18th November 2019 at 17:48 in Belmarsh prion in his own cal block
by suspension.

Me Cope was remanded to HMP Penton in relation to an offence of attempted
‘murder. He was placed on an ACCT on 12th August due to suicidal thoughts - he was
‘ery stressed about hs fal and missing his daughter

He then moved to HMP Belmarsh on 2nd September and referred to mental health team,
Substance misuse, counseling and general practioner on 3rd September.

During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concer. In
my opinion there isa risk that future deaths could occur unless action is aken. Inthe
cumstances Is my statutory duly to report fo you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as folows. —

(1) The transfer and review of prisoners on an ACCT.
lam concerned in relation tothe ability of any Prison to close an ACCT, withthe
attendance of 2 individuals (a prison and health care staf), after a short period
‘of time on a newly transferred inmate (.e. toa new prison) before anyone has
had the time to review and assess him or her
For ACCTs created on current inmates within an establishment, who are known
to staff, do not see that as an issue, they would already have an existing
‘knowledge and relationship and indeed would have been the originator of the
ACCTinany event.

However, for new prisoners, who have arrived from another prison
establishment with an open ACCT on their record, I consider the ability to
‘remove that individual from the ACCT, within a short period of time, does ralze
Issues in respect of the knowledge and understanding ofthat individual andthe
ability of various agencies, within the prison to have had time to review and
‘communicate between themselves, bout that individual

The provision of in affect 2 ‘no’ answers bya prisoner, i a potentially easy way
cof coming off an ACCT, which is therefor their support and well-being, and |
would suggest, sven to easy manipulation

I raise the issue as to whether there shouldbe, for example @ set review period
{2.7 days) which allows time for the support services to meet with and
Interview the transferred inmate, interact, and then make a decision about and
with the newiy transferred prisoner on the ACCT before such an ACCT is closed,

‘unless a patient is having ""bad thoughts”. Your report states that an
‘emergency appointment was not requested and at no point wast suggested
the call was a mental health emergency.

The Medical Centre provided me with a recording of the telephone exchange
between Siwan and the receptionist. | found during the inquest that Sivan
asked repeatedly if she could have an earlier appointment and was clearly
upset that she could not. She was not asked if she was having bad thoughts or

28 and 29,

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(On 1 May 2018 the Area Coroner for Mid Kent & Medway commenced an
investigation into the death of Lee Ryan Thrumble who died, aged 26, on 18
‘April 2018 at the Medway Maritime Hospital, Windmill Road, Gillingham, Kent
ME? 5NY.

2nd Floor
Maidstone

Kent

ME14 1XD
The investigation concluded on 26 August 2027 at the end of an inquest,
conducted by me sitting with a jury. The jury concluded that Lee, who was a
prisoner at HMP Rochester at the time, had died as a result of ""Suicide to which
failures to meet Lee's mental health needs contributed and to which failures to
respond adequately to Lee's deteriorating behaviour in March and April 2018
contributed.” The medical cause of death was:

la, Hypoxic Brain Injury and Pneumonia
Ib. Cardiac Arrest (resuscitated)

Ic. Partial Suspension

I

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Lee was a serving prisoner at HMP Rochester when he suspended himself by
the neck whilst in a cell in the Segregation Unit at HMP Rochester on 17 Apri
2018.

Lee had been recalled to prison on the 2nd January 2018. Whilst at HMP
Eimley he was put on an Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork
ACCT’) plan. He was referred to mental health services on 17 January 2018.
His mood stabilised with treatment and support from the mental health team,

However, the fact that Lee was under the care of the prison mental health team.
at HMP Elmley was not recorded on relevant systems and so, when Lee was
transferred to HMP Rochester, he was not provided with any mental health
‘support. In addition, a previous referral for 1-1 psychology treatment was not
communicated effectively to the receiving prison.

(On arrival at HMP Rochester Lee did not receive a health screening within 24
hours of arrival. When the health screening was carried out, sufficient time was
not allocated which led to health issues being recorded inaccurately.

‘The jury found that: “There was also a lack of training at this prison which led
to a failure to record and review information effectively. Lee did not receive a
‘meaningful clinical interaction after the initial health screening and prior to
being found partially suspended on the 17/04/18. This is a failure within the
system, Lee's mental health needs were not met appropriately at this prison
‘and this more than trivially contributed to his death on the balance of
probabilities. There was a deterioration in Lee's presentation in March/April
2018 for example refusing to work, distancing himself from others and
‘appearing quieter. Adequate steps were not taken to support his deterioration
and this contributed to Lee's death.

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS:

During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to
‘concer. In my opinion, there isa risk that future deaths will occur unless action
is taken. In the circumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

Evidence was given by a Prison Service Govemor and HMP Rochester, the
Head of Healthcare at HMP Rochester and (by letter) Prison-NOMIS
Application Support And Change Manager that:

(1) Critical information relating to prisoners contained on his Prison
National Offender Management Information System (‘NOMIS’).

(2) Prison Service staff and clinical staff working with prisoners are
permitted to (and need) access NOMIS in order to keep prisoners safe.

(3) Use of NOMIS is restricted to those who have been trained to use it (via
a short online course known as the ‘Getting Started’ module). Once the
online training has been completed the person is issued with a
certificate. That cerlificate is then provided to the MOJ Business
Application Support Team / Justice Digital & Technology. That
department then issues the person a NOMIS username and password.
‘The turnaround time is usually two days.

(4) Whilst all prison staff were trained in the use of this system and were
able to access it, only some clinical staff are able to access NOMIS.

(6) The reason that all Prison Service Staff were able to access NOMIS
was because training in the use of NOMIIS is a compulsory part of their
training,

(6) The reason that only some clinical staff could access NOMIS was
because it is voluntary (although encouraged and supported by the
MO\).

(7) If NOMIS training was @ compulsory part of training for all clinicians
working with prisoners:

a. Its likely that most (if not all) nurses would be able to access
NOMIS within a relatively short period of time.

'. Prisoners would, as a resull, be saler.

. The Business Application Support Team / Justice Digital &
Technology at the MOJ would welcome and support such

training (see attached letter {07 ms {ro
that team dated $ September 2021).
|lam concerned that:

(a) Lee died partly because of a lack of training which prevented staff from
accessing and reviewing information,

(b) NOMIS contains important information that can be of use to clinical staff
when looking after prisoners.

(6) Not all nurses can access NOMIS because it is not a compulsory part
of their training,

(d) The NOMIS training is already available, can be completed online and
access to NOMIS can be gained within two days,

(e) If the current situation continues there is a risk that prisoners may die
as a result

This situation should be reviewed and consideration given to whether NOMIS
training should be made compulsory for clinicians working within prisons in
England and Wales.

‘ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and | believe
that you andior your organisation have the power to take such action.

You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this

5 | CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise
to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur
unless action is taken. In the circumstances itis my statutory duty to
report to you

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —
The inquest heard evidence that Mrs Pimlott had been struggling with her
‘mental health in the weeks preceding her death and had contacted her
GP on a number of occasions with anxiety and depression. She was
prescribed medication but expressed concerns about the impact of the
‘medication. Telephone consultations rather than face to face

‘appointments continued to be used with her due to the pandemic. Pre
Covid it was accepted she would have been seen face to face which
Would have allowed a more comprehensive assessment of her mental
health and her reluctance to use medication.

Her GP practice did not refer her to the crisis team, and it was unclear
what guidance the practice had for their GPs about when they should
refer directly to the crisis team.

‘ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and |
believe you have the power to take such action

YOUR RESPONSE

You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date

3. INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

‘On 4 October 2019 | commenced an investigation into the death of Todd James Salter. The
investigation concluded at the end of the inquest . The conclusion of the inquest was:

Suicide

1a. Suspension by ligature

4, CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Mr Salter was released from prison on licence in July 2019. Upon his release there was confusion
regarding which organisation had responsibilty to assist him with housing leading to him residing with
his family. This had a deleterious effect on Mr Salter’s mental health as independent living was a key
‘element of him being able to re-establish contact with his daughters. As time progressed Mr
Salter's struggles with life increased, the spice habit he had in prison combined with life challenges
led to him taking ilict drugs. Although Mr Salter wished to overcome his drug habit he and his family
‘struggled to obtain support needed from the various agencies. Of note was that the Probation officer
who had been assigned to Mr Salter stated in evidence that she did not know that an option available
to her was to contact ASPIRE Drug and Alcohol Service for Doncaster. She further stated in evidence
that she did not know that they could have referred Mr Salter for an assessment, could have sought
advice from a Consultant psychiatrist and could have liaised with mental health services together with
Mr Salter’s mother. These were all crucial elements in providing Mr Salter with the support he clearly
needed. As it was, the Probation officer was exploring options to have Mr Salter recalled but
‘communication with Mr Salter as to her intentions in this regard were far from clear. By the 30""
September 2019 he was at crisis point, left his mother’s address, made his way to Doncaster police
station where at some time between 02:41 a.m. and 07:15 a.m. on the 1% October 2019 Mr Salter
hanged himself outside the police station.
5. CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concer. In my opinion
there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances itis my
statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

(1) The lack of knowledge of the Probation officer as to the services she could contact to obtain
necessary mental health assessments. This would appear at the very least to suggest this gap in
knowiedge may be due to inadequate training,

(2) Mr Salter being driven to desperate measures of committing criminal acts in an effort to be
arrested or recalled in order to secure treatment and support; this appeared to be the way matters
‘were moving forward without engaging with appropriate mental health services.

(3) Generally poor engagement and collaborative working with both agencies and family alike.
6. ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

Inmy opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and | believe you. National
Probation Service have the power to take such action
7. YOUR RESPONSE

You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by
13"" July 2021. |, the coroner, may extend the period

She had a history of mental health difficulties, including a diagnosis of PTSD, and was under the care of the CMHT. However, concerns were raised about the lack of a properly allocated Care Co-Ordinator and the routine allocation of the role to her Consultant Psychiatrist, which was seen as a ""box-ticking"" exercise to satisfy the record-keeping system.

regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013,

3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(On 16 Apri 2020, an investigation was commenced into the death of JAMES MICHAEL NOWSHADI
aged 23 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 23 June 2021. The
Conclusion of the inquest was

‘+ James’ death was a suicide, caused by him deliberately ingesting sodium nitrate

‘© James had a long-standing history of depression for which he was latterly involved with the
CCemridgeshre & Peterborough NHS Foundation Mental Health Trust, and had expressed his
clear intent to end his own life by taking sodium nitrate that he had ordered via the internet
‘rom Poland, Because he was deemed to have capacity, it was nt thought appropriate to inform
his family (with whom he lived) of his intentions, even i their intervention could have potentially
prevented his death

‘+ There was litle knowlege or understanding of the role of sodium nitrate in suicides by those
Involved in James’ care and insufficient exploration of how James had alighted upon sodium
nitrate as the means by which he proposed to end his life, which meant that there was also
Inadequate consideration of whether this could be afactorin other patients’ suicidal ideation,

“CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

James had 2 history of depression and low mood. From 2016 onwards, he was in receipt of regular
therapy and counseling which seemed to have improved his mental wellbeing but in erly 2020, he
was referred to mental health services when he began expressing specific plans to end his own life.
James was seen by clinicians from various teams where he disclosed further details about his
Intentions. He did not want information about his plans to be disclosed to his family. James was
Considered to have capacity ta make decisions about his care. Although consideration was pven to
wether to override his stated wishes and inform his family so that they could help to safeguard him,
it was fet that the risk of suicide was insufficiently imminent to warrant breaching his right to
confientilty

Prior to commencing treatment, James had ordered via the internet a quantity of sodium nitrate

‘which he propared to take ata future date ara means of ending hie fe, He wae open about his plane
with those treating him but could net be persuaded to share his thoughts with his family nor dispose
ofthe sodium nitrate. He agreed to continuing engagement with mental health services and was,
‘deemed not to mest the erteria for admission to hospital.

In ate March 2020, James had not put into effect his plans and appeared to be looking forward to
Starting 2 new job and engaging with new psychological treatment options. On the evening of 31
‘March 2020, James was found unresponsive in his Bedroom atthe family home, before he had 2
Seizure. An ambulance was called and paramedics attended and gave him emergency care but he
went into cardiac arrest. He was taken to Addenbrooke's hospital where despite further attempts at
resuscitation, he was pronounced dead at 01.47 hours on 1 April 2020. Tests on his blood revealed
that he had @ methaemoglobin level of 90% 25a key consequence of ingesting the sodium irate. It
‘e very unlikely that any further medical intervention could have changed the outcome and the
prolonged period in cardiac acest was thought tobe uncurvivable,

'5 CORONERS CONCERNS

During the course ofthe inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern In my opinion,
there isa risk that future deaths could accur unless action is taken. Inthe circumstances, its my
statutory duty to repor to you

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERNS are 2 follows

1. There does not appear to be any national guidance avaiable to psychiatrists and mental heath
practitioners dealing with possible sodium nitrate/nitrite cases. Those involved in James’ care
‘made insufficient effort to research or evaluate the potential risks and consequences of lames
‘obtaining and using the sodium nitrate to end hie life and any information that was obtained
fom brief internet searches war not diseminated to colleagues beyond those immedately
Involved in James’ case only. | am concerned that there isa risk of future fatalities if mental
health practitioners do not have ready access to timely and up-to-date information about the
risks associated wit sodium nitrate/nitrite

2. The family raised cancesns about the risks of sodium nitrate in suicides as part of the Serious
Incident Review undertaken by the Trust but this section was omited from the final report atthe
rection ofthe SIR review panel. The meant that there wae 2 missed opportunity forthe Trust
to reflect on lessons that may property be learned from James’ death, an omision which they
now appear tobe taking steps to remedy. However, | am concerned that there isa risk of future
fatalities at a national lve f Mental Heath Trusts are not using Serious Incident Reviews and
other intemal investigations to learn lessons from suicide cases, including about the risks
resented by sodium nitrate/nitrite

3, The inquest heard evidence from a senior Accident & Emergency doctor about the information
available from the National Polzons Information Service to emergency departments who
encounter patents who have ingested sodium nitrate/nitte. Ths included information about
the potential availablity of an antidote, ‘methylene blue’. However, there is apparently no
‘national guidance about the appropriate use of the antidote in cases involving cardiac arrest and
wether attempts should be made to administer it in such cases. | am concermed that there is 3
Fisk of future fatalities if ARE clinkciane do not have access to comprehensive and up-to-date
Information about toxic substances and their possible antidotes to know when ~ and when not =

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

power to take such action.

Paragraph 7, Schedule 5, and

‘The Corone’s (Investigations) Regulations 2013,
regulations 28 and 29.

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(On 12 November 2020, one of my assistant coroners, Sarah Bourke,
commenced an investigation into the death of Alan'Howard Foster
Griffin, aged 76 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the
inquest on 2 July 2021. | made a narrative determination as follows.

“Alan Griffin hanged himself at home on Sunday, 8 November 2020.

He killed himself because he could not cope with an investigation into his
conduct, the detail of and the source for which he had never been told
The investigation had been ongoing for over a year and was being
conducted by his former Church of England diocese and subsequently
also by his current Roman Catholic diocese (to whom the Church of
England had passed a short, written summary of allegations that
contained inaccuracies and omitted mention of Father Griffin's earlier
suicide attempt on learning of his HIV status).

Father Griffin did not abuse children. He did not have sex with young
people under the age of 18 He did not visit prostitutes. He did not
‘endanger the lives of others by having sex with people whilst an HIV risk.
‘And there was no evidence that he did any of these things. He was an
HIV positive (viral load undetectable) gay priest.

Death by suicide.”

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Information was passed to a diocesan safeguarding adviser of the
Roman Catholic Diocese of Westminster, by a diocesan safeguarding
adviser of the Church of England Diocese of London & Westminster,
regarding Alan Grifin. Father Griffin had previously left the Church of
England and had taken holy orders in the Roman Catholic Church. After
receipt of some information, the Roman Catholic safeguarding team
investigated.

CORONER'S CONCERNS.

During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving
rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur
unless action is taken. In the circumstances, itis my statutory duty to
report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.

1. The safeguarding team of the Roman Catholic Diocese of
Westminster did not exercise sufficient professional scrutiny of the
allegations that came to them fram the Anglican safeguarding
team. This was parlly because they gained a false sense of
security from the fact that the allegations came from the Church
of England,

However, there was more that could have been done to establish
the exact nature of the allegations and whether these were
credible, The Catholic safeguarding team asked for disclosure
from the Anglican safeguarding team and most particularly for the
source of the allegations. When they did not receive elther of
these, they should have insisted.

2. The Catholic safeguarding team met with Father Griffin on 23
June 2020 to discuss his DBS check. That would have been an
ideal opportunity to discuss the Church of England allegations that,
would have shortened the process considerably and the
‘opportunity was lost.

8. Father Griffin then asked to know the allegations against him
before he atlended another meeting with the Catholic
safeguarding team. The safeguarding team felt that the
information was not theirs to give because it came from the
Church of England, but Father Griffin should have been provided
with a note of the allegations promptly

4. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Westminster was unaware of
Father Grifin's attempted suicide nine years earlier. However, it
could still have been more proactive than it was in ensuring that
fhe had maximum pastoral support.

5. The Catholic safeguarding team volunteered at inquest that they
did not deal with the investigation into Father Griffin promptly and
they apologised for this. The very first telephone call was placed
to the Catholic safeguarding adviser on 30 October 2019. The
delay was therefore significant and it was harmful

This was in part because the Catholic safeguarding team were
waiting for the engagement of the Anglican safeguarding team to
enable a joint approach to be taken. When it was clear that such
engagement was not forthcoming (whether for reasons of
sickness or anything else), the Catholic safeguarding team should
have gone back to the local authority designated officer (the
LADO) and recommended that they continue without further input
from the Church of England,

My conclusion at inquest was ‘suicide

4 | CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Hazel Binks died at her son and daughtor-ivlaw's house on 14 January 2021 due to
lack of oxygen caused by her placing a fasioned plastic bag over her head, Hazel had
become concerned that she was suffering from a sexually transmitted disease due to
various symptoms she had alhough upto her death there was no evidence tha this was,
the case, There is reason to consider that there was a degree of iationalty to her
belie, particulary as Hazel referenced an event many many years previously as being
the cause,

‘On 10 January Hazel had made preparations to asphypiate herself with a plastic bag
‘and wrote a farewell note. Her family became aware and was arranged for her to stay
with them to ty and keep her safe

‘On 11 January Hazel had a GP consultation to discuss her physical symptoms. Her
ddaughterin law was with her and raised conceme that Hazel Rad suicidal thoughts,
Hazel explained this as her ‘geting into @ slate’ and the GP did not ask any probing
questions 8 to the deta, intent, or her current thoughls. Hazel was given mental

Telit helpline and self-referral information, advice there was an emergoncy, and was
‘asked to book a two week folow up GP appointment. On the evening before her death
Hazel did not express ary'suiidal thoughts and cid not rise any immediate concems
for her family

‘On the evidence and on the balance of probabilties Hazel undertook a deliberate act
with the intention of taking her own life given the nature of the act, the previous
‘reparations on 10 January, the content of the two notes she left which read as farewell
holes, and her likely state of mind.

[NB - The above summary is taken from the Record of Inquest. By way of further detaliod
Information in relation to this report:

= The daughtor who was with Hazel during the GP consultaton rang the GP
‘surgery just prot to the consultation to express her concem that Hazel had

‘uledal thoughts. On the evidence of the GP, Dr the practice admin had
passed her @ note of the call but tere was’ no meMBoe of anything relating to
sulle.

= During the consutaton Hazo's daugiterintow told the GP that hazel was
‘uicial and had mode plas. Wh reference to suicide Hazel appears to have
explained hereof as ‘goting info a slat and was then very focussed on
physical symptom concems. In evidence OI stated tat she wanted fo
focus on progressing further physical heath essessmnents a5 Hazes woes
‘bout he: physical health appeared fo be civing her arnt. OIG not

‘On the 22” June 2019, Mr Duhaney had been admitted to the Accident and Emergency
Department of Dewsbury District Hospital with both physical and mental heaith concems.

He was assessed by a nurse from the Psychiatric team, who recommended he should be
‘admitted as an informal patient on to a psychiatric ward. However, no bed was available
‘and he was therefore transferred to Pinderfeld's Hospital early on the moming of the 23°
‘June 2019 and admitted on to the Acute Medical Assessment Unit.

Mr Duhaney underwent a futher mental health assessment at 17.00hvs by a member of
the Wakefield Home Based Treatment team following a request by the Kirklees Home
Based Treatment team within whose area Mr Dunaney resided.

Atti point a psychiatric hospital bed could stil not be found within the area (Mr Duhaney
‘had requested to remain in the area as his partner was gravely il)

{At the ime of this assessment an alternative treatment plan was agreed with Mr Duhaney
‘namely that when he was physically well enough to be discharged, he would be provided

With care and suppor in the community setting by the Kirklees Home Based Treatment
‘Team. At the time of this assessment Mr Duhaney was assessed as being at high isk of
further mental health deterioration.

Following assessment the Wakefield Home based Treatment team referred Mr Duhaney
back to the team in Kirklees,

Itappears that at no time either at the time of transfer or during his admission was Mr
Dunaney referred tothe psychiatric services within Pinderfeld's Hospital

In the ensuing days the Kirklees Home Based Treatment team made telephone contact,
with both Mr Duhaney and Acute Medical Assessment uni, leaving contact telephone
<etails and a request that they be contacted and notified when Mr Duhaney was to be
discharged

appears Doctors on the ward believed Mr Ouhaney was awaiting a hospital Psychiatric
assessment

(On the afternoon of 25"" June 2019 Mr Duhaney approached a member ofthe nursing
team at the nurses station and stated he wished to self-discharge.

Blood test results were stil awaited. The nurse gave evidence atthe inquest, she stated
that she spoke toa female doctor the identity of whom she could not recall advising her of
Mr Duhaney’s wishes, the doctor dd not undertake an assessment upon Mr Duhaney, the
‘urse proceeded to warn Mr Duhaney that his discharge was against Medical advice and
got him to sign the appropriate form,

‘The nurse in evidence stated she was unfamiliar withthe trusts protocol document
“Standard Operating Procedure for Managing the Discharge of Patients,

Mr Dunaney left the hospital

'No hospital staff member contacted Kirklees Home Based Treatment Team of Mr
Duhaney's se discharge.

‘The lead Investigator of a Serious Incident Investigation Report undertaken by South West
Yorkshire Partnership Trust in respect ofthe involvement of Home Based Treatment
‘Teams stated in evidence that he was advised by the Modern Matron at Pinderfielt's
Hospital that it was normal Practice of the hospital nat to arrange folow up in the
‘community in these crcumstances when it was planned for if, the patient self discharges.

Five days later on 30% June 2019 a staff member from Kirklees Home Based Treatment
team contacted Pinderfield's Psychiatric Liaison Team seeking an update upon Mr
Duhaney, only to be advised that Mr Duhaney had self discharged $ days previously.
Immediate steps were taken by Kirklees Home Based Treatment to try and make contact,
with Mr Dunaney to no gain. AS a result the police were contacted who attended at his
home, now the early hours of 1* July 2019, they forced entry and found Mr Duhaney with
4 length of medica plastic piping around his neck which had been secured to an adjoining
door handle, his death was confirmed a short time later by an attendant paramedic.

Mr Duhaney appeared to have been dead for some time, he was stil wearing hospital

‘A doctor treating Mr Malinski confirmed that he had died as a consequence ot:

1)a) Traumatic brain injury: due to
1)b} Gun shot injury to the head,

‘By way of conclusion, | recorded that Mr Malinski died as a consequence ot
suicide

| CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

MrMalinski was an aie-rile owner who used to frequent a shooting range at
Weir Mil, Mosoley, Tameside. The range in question constitutes a ‘Miniature
Rifle Range’ forthe purposes of s11 (4) Firearms Act 1968,

(On 2"" November 2020, Mr MalinsKi attended the range with his airrile. Later
in the day, Mr Maliki was loaned a semi-automatic Hammerli Tact 22 rim fire
rile to shoot, and supplied with 50 rounds of 0.22 calibre ammunition

\Wniist alone on the range, Mr Malinski turned the rifle on himself and fred a
shot inthe direction of his ight temple. Mr Malinski received prompt first aid and
‘emergency services were quickly summoned, however died later in hospital as a
consequence of the qun shot.

‘A Greater Manchester Police investigation concluded there were no suspicious
Circumstances, nor any suggestion of third party involvement in respect of his

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to
concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action
is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ~

{tis a matter of concern that the continued existence and operation of S11 (4)
Firearms Act 1968 enables miniature rile ranges to operate within only minimal
regulation, with attendees able to fre miniature rifles and ammunition not
‘exceeding 23 calibre and air weapons in a largely unregulated environment.
In addition, it is a matter of particular concer that the following specifi
requirements do not currently apply to miniature rile ranges:

1), Requirement for the user to sign a prohibited person (Section 21)

declaration on each and every visit;

2) Requirement for the weapon to be securely tethered so that any
projectile discharged from it can only be ‘down range’;

3) Requirement for a competent Range Conducting Officer (‘RCO’) to
bo present on the range at all imes to enable effective supervision of
the shooter;

4), Requirement for the weapon to be loaded for the customer by the
RCO or other member of staff so ammunition may be accounted for;

'5) Requirement for the RCO or other member of staff present tobe first
ad trained with a fst aid kit present;

66) Requirement for any weapon or ammunition used on the range to be
kept secure, controlled and supervised by a member of staf at all
times,

‘ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and | believe you
‘and your organisation have the power to take such action.

YOUR RESPONSE

You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date ofthis

HUTTON, a prisoner at HMP Long Lartn, who died atthe prison on 8 2.19, being 39
years of age

‘This investigation concluded atthe end ofthe inquest on 27 5.21

‘The medical cause of death was:

‘The conclusion ofthe inquest was as folows: |

“Geoftey Hutton died as the result of suicide.

tis hearing and communication needs, and make reasonable adjustments,
‘accordingly, probably caused or contributed to Mr. Hutton death,

4 | CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Mr Hutton hanged himself in his cel at HMP Long Larin on 8.2.19, having made a
ligature from the drawstring of a laundry bag. He hada significant hearing mpaiment,
wth cochlear implants in both ears; when those implants were not working he was,
profoundly deat. He also had recognized longstanding mental health and substance

‘risuse issues, n respect of which he was Raving regular contact withthe inclusion
team in prison

‘Atte time of his death, he was the subject of an ACCT document which had been
‘Span for some 2 weeks ~his second ACCT since his aval at HMP Long Latin on
19.1218

IM Huton frequently expressed feelings of isolation and concern over his inability to
have contact wh is family and parner because of his hearing dificutes, and on
Several occasions sel-harmed oF threatened to sel-narm because of the frustration
he felt about his

[ithe time of his death, no socal care referral had been made and therefore no social
Care plan was in pace which identified and sought to meet his needs which resulted
from his hearing issues.

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concer.
Inmy opnion there is eek that future deaths wil occur uniess action is taken Inthe
Ccreumstances tis my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as folows. ~

(1) No social care referral had been made for Mr. Hutton, despite the need for
‘One having been identfied s00n afer his aval at HMP Long Larin. This was |
Because no effective system for making such referrals tothe relevant Local
‘thoy appeared tobe In place atthe prison atthe time ofthese events.
“The Sater Custody team were responsibe for making such releral, but
‘embers ofthat team suggested mn evidence that they had insufcient time to
‘dea wth such sues. The Safer Custody lead at the me ofthese events
(gave evidence as flows:

{2 social care referral, onthe correct form as per the pison's Adut
‘Safeguarding Poly. was never made

(b) such referral should have been made within days of Mr. Huton’s artvat
atthe prison

(c) he was unable to explain why the system had broken down, but agreed
that offcers within his team ad then, and continue to have insufficient
time to devote to Equally & Disability issues:

(@) there i stl no traning in place to ensure that offcers are abe o identity
the need fora social cae releral, and know how to make such a referral

(2) There appears to be no effective system for allocating ACCT Case
Managers at HMP Long Larin. The officer (Officer A) wo, when she
pened the final ACCT document fr Mr. Hutton, appointed hersefas Case |
Manager or his ACCT, dd so knowing that she would have no contact with
rim over the Following two weeks. Officer A gave evidence that
{@) this was common pracce at the prison
(6) officers were discouraged from not naming a Case Manager when they

‘pened an ACCT, even if (35 here )t was opened at right
(o) she was hoping that another offcer might take it over from her.
[As he predicted, se herself id indeed have no further contact with Mr.
Hutton Furthermore, this problem was not passed on or identified, and no
‘other oer took over the Case Manager role. Therefore there was NO
ttlecve oversight of an ACCT involving a potentially very vunerable
Indivedual
‘Of particular concern is that another officer appears to have filed in Officer
‘Xs details inthe ""name"" and signature” boxes atthe foot of the ACCT
‘Garemap, and dated them 72.19 the day before Mr. Hutton's death ).
thereby ging the impression that Oficer Ahad reviewed and satisfied
herself thatthe actions identified in the Caremap had been dea with. Infact.
the most important acton on the Caremap, which required a social care
‘eferal, had not been complete. J

‘This lack of fective oversight was not confined to Mr. Hutton's final ACCT
‘document. For his fist ACCT document at HMP Long Larin, only a month
earlier the named Case Manager had no involvement with unt the fourth
ACCT Case Review, and made no enties on the Caremap ( which was
‘signed of by a diferent officer)

| near evidence from @ member ofthe curent Senior Management Team at

the prison that

(a) there is currently no formal training forthe allocation of, or flfiment ofthe
duties ofthe ACCT Case Manager tle

(b) this wl be reviewed, and training wil be organised.

‘The lack of an effective ACCT Case Manager, who is able to provide
‘proper oversight ofan ACCT, is an issue which was raised by me ina
previous Report to Prevent Future Deaths which followed the death of
another prisoner at HMP Long Lartin( David KIRSCH ~ report dated
sos0.49)

(9) Not al prison staff who carry out ACCT observations on vulnerable
prisoners at night have received ACCT training.
This issue became apparent when the Operational Support Grade member of
staff OSG ) who found Mr. Hutlon on the mocning of his death gave
‘evidence tothe inquest. Not only ha he not received any taining about the
‘ACCT procedure atthe time ofthese events, that remains the cate now.
| ""heard evidence from a member ofthe current Senior Management Team at
the prison that OSGs are curently required to cary out ACCT observations at
‘ight, but that ACCT training fr them snot mandatory and some have
therefore not received such training, |
| Itis of concer that those carrying out potentially critical observations on very |
vulnerable prisoners may not be aware of what the ACCT procedure involves,
‘or what it may require of them ifthey have any concerns about a prisoner

‘ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

|nmy pinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and | believe you have
the power to take such action by conducting an investigation ino the deficiencies and
failures outed above, and by conducting a review of the social care referral process
| and the ACCT process within your prison

‘5 CORONER'S CONCERNS
‘The MATTERS OF CONCERNS are as flows:

During the cours ofthe inquest nto the death of Mark Culverhouse it came apparent, and
indoed was accepted thal his datention at HMP Woodhill from the 18th of Apri 2019 unt the 23rd
(of Apri 2019 wae unlawful. He had been recaled under the terms of his icenee having been
Feleased from Peterborough prison onthe 12th of Api 2019. The calculation of his release date
‘was nol conducted by the offender management unital the prison untl the 23rd of Api 2019, after
the extended Easter bank holiday. was told that there was no process in place whereby a
pisoner’s rlaase is calculated until such time as they come back into custody. The prison and,
Brobation ombudsman brought this matter fo the atlenton ofthe prison service recommending that
the release date calculation should take place within one working day ofthe prisoner arivingin
prison. lcannol see how that can be acceptable particularly whore, in Me Culverhouse's case, it
tiould have made no aference bacause ofthe bank holiday | consider that here wats a cleat link
between he unlawl detention and his eventual death onthe 2Ath of Apr 2019 and in order to
prevent similar deaths inthe future, I beiove an urgent review fs required and the system changed
{o ensure that the calculation ofthe release date is made pio othe decision to recal being taken,
This will avoid the possibly of anyone being unlawfuly imprisoned inthis county under similar
Greumstancas

During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters gving ise to concern. In my
‘pinion tere isa rk that future deaths could occur unless action Is taken. In the
Ccroumstances its my slatutory duty to report fo you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN ae as folows. —

‘At Kesia's Inquest | heard that ner place of residence, City Road in Winchester, was a
‘esdental housing unit for winerable young people aged 16-21. The facility meets s housing
‘need onl forthe young persons placed there. It was found on the evidence that AZ Dominion
‘employees cid not have sufcent raining of tols (Le. implements) in place to prepare sa for
the situation that they faced on the 20"" January 2020 when they found Kesia hanging inher
oom, nar coud they cary out any physical actons to assist her (ie. cut her down). There
‘appeared tobe no prior appreciation ofthe risks) of selt-narm, overdose or attempted sulede
‘ofresidens, and so on iscovering Kesia suspended inher room, the staf were nadequataly
propared on multe loves,
(@) | heard that whilst there has been addltenal traning for he staff on areas of isk such
2s sol-harm, overdose ancior suicide, here have Bean no physical changes in terms.
‘lth provision of tools and implements that staff could use should they be confronted

‘bya young parson in distress andlor in need of Me-saving atonion. appears io me
that witout mult-factonal changes there remains areal and sgnifeant rik that sat!
athe residential units wil reman unable to take any immediate and potential ife-
saving action. The only tools and equipment tat remain supplied isa slandaré home-
siyle frst ad kt which is enialyineffecive #a young person has suspended
themselves from a igature.

() Although addtional training and courses have been added to both the induction
traning and on-going professional development of staf within the residential units
similar to City Road, | remain concerned by the way in which key policies and taining
‘are communicated and implemented as this does not appear to have changed. It was
lear from the evidence that updates to policies are emaled to employees with a
‘aquest thatthe employee responds 1o te email to conf receipt. This proved tobe
wholly ineffective as what appeared tobe expected by the company was thatthe
‘employee would ead, digest and understans the policy. and confi when he/she hac
{done $0. The employee on dutyon the 20"" January 2020 was clearly unfamisar win
the appropriate polices and hag ony confirmed that he had received the ema (which
‘appeared tobe al that was requred) and not that he had actualy read, digested and
Understood the appropriate polices: how to apply them in practice and what was
reasonably expected of him. Although enhanced ns waning now pace, appears
tome that without any enhanced diligence to ensure that potcies are actualy read
‘and understood by those working face-o-face wih the vulnerable young adults then
‘he overall effecivoness of sk training and identifcation is severely awe,

3 [INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

‘An investigation commenced on 13 September 2018 into the death of SAMANTHA
JANE GOULD (Sam) aged 16. Tho investigation concluded at the end of the inquest
‘90,16 April 2021. The conclusion of tha inquast was!

‘+ Sam died by sulci by an overdose of prescribed medication.

{The main cause of Sam's death was her borderine personality disorder, which
treating cinicans ascessed fo be related fo allegations of prolonged sexual
abuse in her earier childhood. ‘The disorder caused a persistent but
Unpredictable and fictuating rsk o serious delberatesell-harm and suicide

‘+ Thore was a wider narrative conclusion, the aspect most relevant to this report
being that

“Tiere was a systemic weakness and failing in the lack of a protocol for
{Chid and Adolescent Mental Health Service ~ CAMS] and the GP service
{0 communicate with local pharmacies concerning 16-18 year old patients
‘ith mental heath condlions who were at nek of deliberate overdose. Sam
Was therefore able (0 pick up older prescriptions on 1 September 2018
Uihout challenge. It was those medeations that were fatal in the
‘Combined amounts Sam ingested an the night of 1-2 September 2018.""

4 | CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

“There was a safely plan agreed with Sam's consultant peychiatist whereby, although
‘Sam was aver the age of 16, Sam's parents would be responsible for her medication.

(On 30 August 2018, Sam's treating psychiatrist in the community made a change to
‘Sam's medication giving her a paper prescription. Sam expressed a preference fo tell
her mother about the change in mediation (new prescription of Topramate) directly
and the psychiatrist had to make a judgement call whether or not to breach medical
Confidence and tol Sam's mother about this crecly.On balance she chose not to. In
the event, Sam di not tll ner mother about the new prescription, Shorty belore t pm
‘on Salurday 1 September 2018, Sam instead went to her local pharmacy with the
proscription for Topiramate and Lorazepam. She colectedthase medications as well as

‘older prescripona for over medeations she would previously not have known were
being held there. At her home on School Lane, Fulbourn at some time after 01.23 09
the moming of 2 September 2018, Sam took a very large quantity of some of the
proscrbved medications. She went to bed, fell unconscious and died wihin at most a
‘couple of hours.

‘The local pharmacy (who do not have access to patients’ records on SystmOne) had
not been fold about the safety plan. As Sam was 16 years old, she was assumed
‘competent to take her own prescriptions and the pharmacists had na immediate reason
nol to provide them to Sam, being ignorant o the saety plan

‘(CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course ofthe inquest the evidence reveled matters giving rise o concern,
In my opinion, theres a isk that future deaths could occur uness action i taken. Inthe
‘Grcurstances tis my statutory duly to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN areas follows:

(1) There did not appear to be any national guidance or standards that directed or
encouraged appropriate sharing of risk information and care plans with the local
pharmacy. AS\2 resuil, the pharmacy was unsighted on the fact thatthe treating
psychiairc team had a safely plan involving Sam's parenis being responsible for
Fading and administering all medication. Had the pharmacy been aware ol this plan,
iis tkcely that they would ether have retused to provide the medication with which Sam
‘overdosed or, a least, contacted Sam's parents or General Practitoner.

(2) A local protocol has now been introduced whereby the Cambridgeshire and
Peterborough Foundation Trust's Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service ensures
that any pharmacy used regularly by ther patients aged 16-17 are (where appropriate)
advieed of relevant care plans, ae well as tha responsble GP being 20 Informed. This
is now to be par of mandatory traning for CAMHS prescribing stall and is to be
‘discussed inte local Joint Prescribing Group to ensure better communication between
the local NHS Trusts, G..s and local pharmacies. Accordingly. action has already been
taken inthe local area to prevent sila fatalities.

However,

(3) 1am concomed that there is risk of future fatalities it action isnot taken ata national
level to ensure that pharmacies are appropriately involved in medication safety plans
formental health patents aged 16 17, avon that such patients may olherwise be able
lo oblain prescribed medication wih which to overdose

(0n 28 August 2020 | commenced an invesugation into the death of Angola Marie FROST. The investigation
‘concluded at the end of the inquest on 21 May 2021. The medical cause of death was (1a) Amiripiyine
(Overdose. ‘The conclusion ofthe inquest was ‘suicide whist the balance of her mind was disturbed.

CIRCUMSTANCES OF DEATH

‘The Deceased was admitted to Aspen Ward, Royal Oldham Hospital on 8 June 2020 folowing 2 mixed
‘overdose. She complained of sensations which included feeling that her insides ‘eli, that she hed ‘hot
lava’ and ‘snakes inher stomach’ and a brain haemorrhage causing Wicking in her head” Hormonal tests
Undertaken during the admission estabished that the Deceased was post-menopausal, The Consultant
PPeychitrist with responsibilty forthe Deceased was of the opinion that the sensations where related tothe
‘menopause rather than a psychosis. A GP trainee spoke to a Gynaecology Registrar who advised that HRT
‘was contraindicated and recommended the use of herbal alleratves. The Deceased declined to take the
herbal allornative and was discharged from the ward on 2 July 2020 on ant-psychote medication. The
‘Consultant Psychiatrist recommendation that a referral be made by primary care to Gynaecology to discuss
[HRT atternatves was not communicated tothe Deceased GP.

‘On 21 July 2020, the Deceased was re-admtied to Aspen Ward ater being located in woodland. She had
‘been missing for 7 ‘days with the express inlenton that she starve herself to death. During her second
‘mission, her anti-psychotic medication was increased. The Consuitant Psychiat formulated a diagnosis
‘of profound menopause with secondary kinaestheic hallucinatory experiences.” These dagnosis does nat
feature in ICD-10 and a second opinion was nol requested or obtained by the Consultant Psychiatrist. No
contact was made with the Speciast Pharmacist attached to the locality to establish whether HRT was
Coniraindcated and no further contact was made with the Gynaecology team. Had enquties been made with
the pharmacy team, it Is more likly than not that it would have established that HRT was not absolutely
‘onttaindicated and therefore would have been a potential treatment option

“The Deceased's family members were not involved in discussions around all avaible treatment options and
despite leaving messages forthe Consuitant Psychiatrist to contac them, sufcient enquries were nol made
‘8510 whether the Deceased consented to their Involvement In her care. It's more likely than not that had
‘sufficient enquires been made, the Deceased would have consented to sharing information with her family
‘which would have provided her witha source of support in her decision-making,

“The Deceased took her own discharge from the ward on 7 August 2020. A table-top review meeting was held
‘on the same day in which the Eary Intervention Team were updated on the Deceased's condition. The
Deceased was last seen by @ mental health professional on 20 August 2020 during which she described an
Improvement in her symptoms. She was found deceased al her home address on 24 August 2020 having
taken anintortional overdose of her partner's old medication,

and Regulations 28 and 29 ofthe Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013,

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

James Devenny died on 2 September 2019 at HMP Eimiey, aged 34 years. An
investigation into his death was commenced. The investigation concluded at the end of
the inquest on 18 May 2021. The jury found that the medical cause of Mr Devenny's death
was hanging. Their conclusion was that he died of an accidental death and there was a
failure to open an ACCT document which caused or contributed to his death. The jury
also found a series of factors possibly contributed, as explained further under section 4
below.

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

James Devenny died in his single occupancy cell on House Block 2. in HMP Elmley at
‘some point between 1493 and 1558 on 2 September 2019 when he was found, hanging
{rom a light fiting in his cell using a ligature made from a bedsheet.

Prior to his death Mr Devenny had been isolated in his cell due to a concem that he posed
a risk of violence. The jury found that Mr Devenny’s Death was possibly contributed to by
the folowing factors:

(1) Staff on houseblock 2 at HMP Emley were not aware of information as to his
history of seltharm which occurred before he arrived there,

{@) Following the decision to Keap Mr Devenny separated from other prisoners, here:
was not an assessment by a medical professional as to whether he was fit tobe
soparated.

(@) The response of the mental health in reach team to referrals in respect of Mr
Davenny was not appropriate.

In addition, the jury noted in their narrative that:

(1) We foe! that lack of access to a phone in cells, to contact support services was
inadequate

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.
In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the
‘circumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN aro as fallows. —

(1) In the absence of telephones which are installed directly into the cel, there is no
direct means for a prisoner to contact the Samaritans. In the event that a prisoner
{does not have access toa telephone they are reliant on staff io convey them to a
telephone so they may call. There is a particular dtficuty in respect of prisoners
who are deemed to pose a risk of violence and who may not be able to
immediately access a telephone, a listener or a member of Chaplaincy.

(2) Prison Officers are not routinely briefed as to prisoners who have previously
significantly self harmed in custody. Itis not clear as to the threshold of severity
required before prison staff willbe informed save that they willbe informed it a
prisoner arrives with an open ACCT. Prison Oificers are not routinely briefed as
to.a prisoner's previous or antecedent pattem of thoughts, feelings, events and
‘behaviours which have led to incidents of significant sel-harm.

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(On 15 May 2020 | commenced an investigation into the death of Matthew MACKELL. The
investigation concluded at the end of the inquest . The conclusion of the inquest was

‘Suicide with additional narrative: Matthew Mackell was found dead on the 7th May 2020 in
Dunorian Park, Tunbridge Wells, Kent. He had suspended himself from a tree using a ligature
with the intention of taking his life. At 22:18 on the 6th May 2020 he had telephoned Kent
Police to inform them of his intention but did not provide his identity or location. Kent Police did
not deploy their available enhanced mapping system which would have provided an accurate
location for Matthew Mackell. This was a missed opportunity, Kent Police did not maintain the
correct ""immediate"" grading of the call, Kent Police did not despatch a patrol to the location of
the deceased in response to the call. It was not possible to establish on the balance of
probability whether the deployment of the enhanced mapping system would have resulted in a
patrol finding Matthew Mackell before he was deceased.

""
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Police were initially called on the morning of the 7th May 2020 by a runner in Dunorlan park.
He stated that he and his wife had been running in the park and had seen a male hanging from)
a tree. Police then attended and located the deceased,

‘The body was initially found hanging from a tree in Dunorlan Park. A bedsheet had been used
as a ligature. The tree was located around 50 metres in to the park from the Pembury Road

4 entrance and was clearly visible from the footpath. The deceased was then cut down and CPR
performed.

It appears that the deceased has had ongoing suicidal thoughts that have been

‘aggravated by relationship troubles.On the evening before his death

the deceased had an argument with his brother. At 2218 hours on Wednesday 6th May 2020,
the deceased made a call to Kent Police Force Control Room in which he stated that he was.
{going to kill himself

‘No name or description was left and so the call could not be further explored,

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS,

‘During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my
copinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances
itis my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

(1) In December 2019 a software update had been installed to a system in the Kent Force
Control room which, if used, produced a much greater accuracy in detecting the location of
‘motile phone calls. There had been inadequate or no training on the use of the update which
resulted in the system not being deployed to locate the deceased. The call from the deceased
‘at 22.18 was therefore incorrectly downgraded as the area to search was regarded as too wide
to be effective. The downgrade was incorrect because (a) the use of the software would have

's provided an accurate location and (b) the call should have been treated as a suicide call and
not an abandoned 999 call. Itis accepted that as a drect result ofthis incident the software
system is now the default setting to detect locations. However, the evidence of those witnesses
who were required to use the system raised a more general enquiry which identified gaps in or
labsence of effective training and the cascading of information.

(2) The totality of the evidence from several experienced operatives in the Force Contral Roam
revealed gaps in their knowledge as to operating procedure in respect of the suicide policy,
‘appropriate downgrading of calls, checking available patrols. Whilst it is accepted that following
‘an IOPC report steps have been taken to review and improve procedures, it was apparent that
there was an absence of an effective system to identify those that required traininglupdating
land of the keeping a record of the specific training/updating received by individual operatives,
land the date it was undertaken. There did not appear to be a structured system in place to
[produce a regular training rotation which monitored and recorded individual satisfactory
progress. Such a system would clearly identity what training/updating had been received thus,
identifying those who might otherwise be missed and when training/updating was scheduled to
take place.

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

The Deceased died on 8"" October 2019 in the garden at his own home in
Manchester trom asphyxiation using a ligature made from a scart. returned a
conclusion of Suicide folowing consideration of the evidence.

(One matter that was investigated was that the Deceased was prescribed the anti
depressant medication, Sertraline. His intial dose was 50mg, and this was then
uplitrated to 100mg and 150mg.

In July 2019 Sertraline was added to the Deceased's repeat prescriptions, despite
evidence of non-compliance prior to this. The repeat prescription was for 28-day
quantities of the 150mg dose. | was told by the Deceased's General Praciitioner that
there is nothing on the GP's EMIS system to confirm whether repeat prescriptions
have been requested. The Deceased had periods of non-compliance with his
Sertraline prescription, and therefore it would have been imperative for the surgery to
ensure that he was requesting (and then collecting) his repeat prescription. This
could not happen due to the limitations of the EMIS system.

1

It was discussed with the GP at the Inquest whether the EMIS system could be
Updated to allow for (automated) alerts to be sent to patients to remind them about
their repeat prescriptions, particularly for those patients who are prescribed anti
depressant medication (or any non-PRN medication),

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to

currently allow for alerts to be sent to a patient to remind them to request and collect,
their repeat prescription to encourage compliance. An automated alert to a patient
could be added to the EMIS system, which would not increase the burden on the

3 [INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(On 25” March 2020 | commenced an investigation into the death of Martin
Gibbons. The investigation concluded on the 22 April 2021 and the conclusion
was one of suicide. The medical cause of death was 12 Hypovolaemic shock, 1b
Neck laceration

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

‘Martin Anthony Gibbons attempted to take his own fe on the morning of 18th
‘March 2020. He had at times in the days previously displayed symptoms
‘consistent with a deterioration in his mental health, He was taken to Tameside
General Hospital. He was assessed as requiring treatment for the wounds he
had inficted on his arms with a kaife and assessment by the mental health
liaison team. The assessment by the mental health liaison team identified he
needed to be admitted o a psychiatric ward. He agreed to that and had he not
‘agreed the mental health team would have sought to section him under the
‘Mental Health Act. He was left at Tameside General Hospital in the designated
‘mental heath room wlst a bed was sought for him. At the time he was left there
was a failure to conduct a detailed risk assessment for the period whist a bed
was sought or to agree a joint plan to manage the risk.

Itis probable that failure contributed to his death. Marin Gibbons left room 14
saying he was going tothe tole. Whit unobserved he left the hospital. He
purchased a Stanley knife just over an hour later in Stalybridge. A full search by
‘Tameside General Hospital stat and Greater Manchester Police was
unsuccessful until 24th March 2020.

(On 24th March 2020 he was found in a secluded area of Stamford Golf Course.
‘There were no suspicious circumstances and no evidence of third party
involvement in his death. Post mortem examination confirmed he was not under
the influence of any substance atthe time of his death and that he had died from
a sol.inflicted neck laceration,

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to
Cconcem. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur uniess action is|
taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty 1 report to you

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

1. During the course of the inquest evidence was heard that the acute and
‘mental health vusts involved had assessed the level of risk he presented
differently in part due to there being no shared definition of risk or the
factors that triggered a patient being treated as high risk. The inquest
hoard that across the NHS there is in relation to mental health na shared
ofintion between acute and mental health trusts of what constitutes a
high risk pationt. The two trusts involved inthis inquest had since Mr
CGibbon's death identified that as an issue and work was underway
‘between them to develop and implement a shared definition locally in the
absence of any shared national definition.

2. The inquest heard evidence that since Mr Gibbon's death both trusts had
recognised that to reduce risk there needed to be detailed and
documented shared risk assessments and care plans for patients such as|
him in an acute setting. The inquest heard that there was no national or
regional guidance in place in relation to this shared care plan approach,

3. twas during the prolonged wait in the Emergency Department for a
‘mental heath bed that Mr Gibbons left. The inquest heard that this wait
was contributed to by a number of factors in particular

+ Anational lack of mental health beds;

+ The fact that although he had presented to Tameside Hospital
and had been assessed by Pennine Care staf because ho was
‘a resident of a neighbouring borough covered by a different
NHS Mental Health Trust that other Trust had to be contacted
‘given all ofthe information and find him a bed. The inquest was
{old that this was as a resul of how services were
‘commissioned and that the workers who had assessed him had
no choice other than to follow this process notwithstanding the
additional delay it created

‘ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you
hhave the power to take such action.

‘YOUR RESPONSE

You are under a duty o respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this
report, namely by 16 July 2021. |, the coroner, may extend the period.

Stephen Thurm. The investigation concluded on the 5 May 2021 and the
Conclusion was one of suicide. The medical cause of death was 1a
Hanging

4 | CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Stephen Thurm endured mental health problems commencing in
adolescence, which were heightened after his sister, Helena, was killed
by a motorist in June 2016.

Stephen was detained at the Moorside Unit at Trafford General Hospital
in September 2016 after he had smashed up his bedroom and threatened
to jump from a high building. Over the following months Stephen's mental
health fluctuated and he often locked himself in his room at the family
home. In December 2016 Stephen took an averdose of medication and
was found barricaded in a hotel room in Manchester. He had repeatedly
denied suicidal ideation. He spent a further period in the Moorside Unit
from December 2016 to April 2017, following which he soon began
isolating himself again. He was detained under the Mental Health Act
again in May 2017,

Stephen's engagement with the mental health team was sporadic. He
Continued to self-medicate with non-prescription drugs, alcohol and ilicit
substances. A further suicide attempt by Stephen was reported by one of
his friends to Stephen's mother. Stephen denied this. He was under the
care of consultant psychiatrists and psychologists but there was no face

To face contact with either discipline after August 2019. Stephen's parents
reported their concems that he remained a suicide risk. Stephen's
behaviour became more unusual and he was displaying paranoia. On 26
November 2019 Stephen went missing and was found by the police and
brought home. He continued to isolate himself and consume excess
alcohol and use cannabis, cocaine and MDMA to self-medicate. On the 5
February 2020 Stephen was found suspended by a rope from a tree near
to the 15th hole of Dunham Forest Golf and Country Club. He died at the
scene on the 5 February 2020 from hanging which is likely to have
resulted in asphyxia.

April 2020. It was resumed on 30® March and concluded on 28"" April
2021,

| found the medical cause of death to be:
la, Hanging

I determined that Hannah took her own life.

Hannah had taken an overdose of medication in October 2019, as a result
of which she was referred by the Psychiatric Liaison Nurse who assessed
her at East Surrey Hospital to Time to Talk service, but this referral was
rejected by Time to Talk as Hannah's suicide attempt rendered her
condition too severe for the service. Her GP then made a routine referral
to Horsham Assessment & Treatment Service (""HATS""), part of Sussex
Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (""the Trust”), for Mental Health

Service input.

Two assessment appointments were made for Hannah; on 26% November
2019 and 4 December 2019 (subsequently changed to 6"" December 2019).

These appointments were recorded as DNAs, although I heard evidence
Hannah had moved address so may not have received appointment
letters and, when notified of the change in the second appointment by
text message, was only told the time of this on the day itself when she
would already have been at work.

No further appointment was made and therefore no action was
effectively taken to progress Hannah’s referral until March 2020, when
the Assessor noted Hannah's name remained on her caseload and
discussed her with the Referrals Coordinator at HATS. An Optin
/Contact letter was sent on 4! March 2020 informing Hannah that, as she
‘was recorded as having failed to attend two appointments, she would be
discharged back to the care of her GP unless she made contact by 20""
March 2020. Hannah was herself made aware of this when she attended
the Urgent Treatment Centre at Crawley Hospital on 5th March 2020
reporting volatile mood and was seen by a Specialist Nurse Practitioner
in Psychiatry, who notified her of the letter and advised her to contact,
HATS,

Hannah was subsequently discharged back to the care of her GP on 1*
April 2020 without having been assessed by HATS.

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Hannah Bampfylde was found hanging deceased in the garage of her
Mother's home address, where she had been staying, in Horley, Surrey. A.
note was found dated 26"" March 2020 in Hannah's bedroom in which she
stated she could not carry on living,

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

Hannah Bampfylde had a long history of mental health problems and
‘was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. Following a settled
period, her mental health deteriorated leadling to the attempted overdose
in October 2019. Following an unsuccessful referral to Time to Talk
services, Hannah was referred to HATS, the entry point into specialist
‘mental health services

Assessment appointments were made for 26% November 2019, which

2

Hannah did not attend, and 4 December 2019, which was altered at
short notice by HATS to 6* December 2019, when Hannah was at work.

No further appointments were made by HATS and Hannah did not
contact the service herself to reschedule. Hannah's GP was not made
aware that she had missed appointments and that she was not therefore
effectively under the care of the service until HATS wrote to the GP on 1*
April 2020 advising them that Hannah had been discharged for not
engagement.

Whilst there was not sufficient evidence before the Court to conclude that
the lack of an assessment by HATS and therefore Mental Health Services,
input into Hannah’s care caused or contributed to her death, the evidence
highlighted a lack of clarity and potential for persons newly referred to
the service to not engage without their GP being aware of this.

The two GPs who had contact with Hannah both stated they were
unaware of any protocols being in place, either at the time of Hannah’s
death or in the interim, to ensure all non-engagement with services
should be communicated with the patient's GP, although the Trust’s own,
Serious Incident Report into Hannah’s death identified that such a
protocol should be in place.

HATS use the Trust's “Active Engagement Incorporating Did Not Attend,
(DNA) Policy & Procedure” (""the Policy”) in governing the standards of
how to promote engagement with service users, to include those awaiting,
assessment and those already under the care of the service.

The Policy provides general guidance to professionals in deciding on the
action to be taken when a person does not attend an appointment with
them, but does not give a clear pathway to avoid newly referred patients
slipping through the system. From the evidence given to the Court, it was,
not clear who was responsible for re-booking appointments in the event
of a DNA, or at what stage non-attendances should be escalated for
review with the Referrals Co-ordinator.

The Policy describes a “Multi-Disciplinary Review Meeting” taking place

prior to a non-attending person being discharged back to primary care,

but this does not apply to new referrals to the HATS where a Multi

Disciplinary team would not be in place and discussion would instead

take place between the Assessor and Referrals Co-ordinator. There was,

no detail of this discussion in Hannah's notes although evidence was
{ven that it had taken place.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are:

= Appointments are not automatically re-booked when a person has
failed to attend an appointment.

= Its not clear who should re-book appointments when a person
hhas failed to attend (Administration or Assessors).

= GPs are not routinely notified if a person has not attended an
appointment with the HATS, meaning the GP would be unaware
the person was not receiving input from the HATS until they had
failed to attend a number of appointments and were discharged
back to primary care, potentially many months after being
referred.

Consideration should be given to whether any steps can be taken to
address the above concerns,

3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(On 8th April 2020, | opened an inquest into the death of Joanna Leven who was
found dead at her home on 26th March 2020, aged 34 years.

‘A post mortem examination undertaken by Dr
Pathologist, determined that Ms. Leven died

“The coronial investigation into her death concluded with the inquest, which was
heard before me on 26th ~ 27th April 2021, resuting in a conclusion that Ms.
Leven had died as a consequence of suicide.

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

‘Ms, Leven was found dead at her home on 26th March 2020 as a consequence
of asphyxia which was self-induced with the intention of bringing about her
death. Ms. Leven was under the care of community mental health services
having previously been diagnosed with Emotionally Unstable Personality
Disorder arising rom traumatic experiences in childhood.

‘As a result of her Personality Disorder, Ms. Leven had frequently self: harmed
andlor attempted suicide, often telling others what she had done. A major
‘Protective factor in maintaining Ms. Leven's safely was her dog.

In February 2020, Ms. Leven's dog became seriously unwell, This led o @
‘profound deterioration in her mental health. After Ms. Leven's dog was
‘euthanized in March 2020, she cut her groin and took a mixed overdose,
‘resulting in her being taken to hospital. Whilst she received treatment there for
hher physical health, Ms Leven left hospital before the mental health liaison team
could assess her.

Despite the ciear deterioration in Ms. Leven's health, the removal of the major
protective factor in maintaining her safely and her e-mailing her care coordinator |
to inform him she intended to complete suicide after leaving hospital, no
‘comprehensive mental health assessment took place.

Itis possible the absence of a comprehensive mental health assessment a this
point in Ms. Leven's life might have contributed to her death.

| The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ~

1) The court heard evidence that there is no national therapeutic pathway for
treatment of Personality Disorders. Whilst the court heard steps are in place to
introduce a local pathway for residents of Greater Manchester, itis understood
lgiblity for and availabilty of various therapies which may be beneficial to.

| patients diagnosed with a Personality Disorder varies from place to place;

| 2) Evidence was heard in cout othe effect that there ae gaps in provision by

| statutory agencies of counseling and other mental heath services specifically
talored for vitims of trauma, violence and domestic abuse. In Stockport,

| speci services of tis nae fli be provided bya registered cary wih
nly short-term funding in place, a postion which is understood to be replicated

elsewhere inthe country,

| 27th court heard evidence that, where a patient attends a Hospital Emergency

Department with both physical and mental health needs, itis usually he case
that Hospital and Mental Health Liaison staff are working with different
‘computer-based records systems. This creates an obvious risk of information
being ost or incompletely conveyed as between different professional groups.

inquest on 28° April 2021. The conclusion ofthe inquest was suicide, the medical
cause of death was 1a Hypoxic Brain Injury 1b Hanging

@._| CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

(On 7"" November 2017 Darren Adams was transferred from HMP Garth (HMPG) to
HMP Lindholme (HMPL). It appears he believed, incorrectly, that there was a
Vulnerable Prisoner Unit (VPU) at HMPL. Staff at HMPG accepted Mr Adams had
asked about a VPU but the fact there was no such unit at HMPL was not relayed
back to him. There was no evidence to say that he would have been placed on a
\VPU even if there had been one at HMPL. Mr Adams had a history of being.
unsettled when moved, even within a prison. The jury found that there was
insufficient information regarding Mr Adam's on his transfer and arrival at HMPL,
Within 24 hours of arrival his mental health deteriorated to such an extent he was
placed on an ACCT. There were insufficient records of his behaviour in the ACCT
‘and a full picture of his mental health was not recorded. Darren was alive at 0641,
hours on 12"" November 2017 but discovered lgatured in his cell at 0738 hours. The
officer discovering Mr Adams waited for additional staff assistance before
attempting to enter the cell however Darren had erected a barricade at his door
which caused an additional slight delay in accessing him. Once the door was
‘opened and barricade removed nursing staff from prison healthcare entered the
cell. The nursing staff carried out a clinical assessment but misdiagnosed him,

Believing him to have hypostasis and rigor mortis. They decided not to commence
CCPR. The nurses had previously been advised by the Prison Service and Probation
‘Ombudsman against commencing CPR when someone is obviously deceased. They
referred to the guidance “Guidance to support the decision-making process of when
not to perform Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation in prisons and immigration removal
centre (IRC)"". When paramedics arrived their clinical assessment found no
hhypostasis, no rigor morts and they also stated he was stil warm. They
commenced CPR and obtained a return of spontaneous circulation 4 times, the last
as he was conveyed to Doncaster Royal Infirmary (ORI). Once at ORI, after a period
of observation and tests Mr Adams was declared dead at 13"" November 2017.

they did not have a sufficient understanding of the process and how to

2. The Nursing Staff misdiagnosed rigor mortis. It was apparent in evidence
that they did not have a sufficient understanding of the process and how to

future deaths for Further evidence to be provided by the 24 March 2021,

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

i.) Mary held a British passport but had lived in America fora long period
prior to coming to England in the autumn of 2017. She lived
temporarily with her sister in Surrey. She was suffering from severe
depression and was admitted to the Abraham Cowley Unit as an
informal patient on the 24% February 2018, She was prescribed.
citalopram,

fi) She wanted to be rehoused in Surrey near her sister. As part of the
discharge planning she was referred to Elmbridge Borough Council
housing department who needed to undertake investigations to
determine if she was eligible for housing,

fil) Mary was an experienced nurse and repeatedly said that the medication
prescribed to her was not working, A date was fied for her
discharge from hospital. She did not want tobe discharged. She
feared being homeless, On the 21"" March 2018 she expressed active
suicidal thoughts and was placed on I to I nursing,

jx.) On the 20nd March 2018 she was seen by her Responsible Clinician, Her

‘medication was increased, her nursing observations were reduced to
every 15 minutes and the discharge planned for the 26 March 2018
was moved to the 27% March 2018 to allow her to see the citizens
advice bureau. The plan was for her to be discharged to the Home
Treatment Team.

+.) Atthat stage it had not been possible for the housing authority to
determine if she was eligible for housing, Her care co-ordinator was
not involved in the decision, No discharge planning meeting took
place,

vvi) On the 27 March 2018 she saw a member of the Home Treatment Team,
and expressed suicidal plans and refused Home Treatment Team
involvement, She continued to say that the medication wasn’t
working, Her discharge was delayed until the following day.

vii) On the 25 March 2018 she agreed to work with the Home Treatment
Team because she was reassured that she could have a medical
review in the community

viii) She was then seen ina ward round and her diagnosis was
erroneously changed to probable mild depression with emotionally
unstable personality disorder traits

fx.) The discharge plan was for her to be housed at the expense ofthe Unit
for7 days at a Travel Lodge. There was no certainty at that stage that
she would be eligible for housing after that date. The plan was that
she was to attend the housing authority as homeless atthe end of
that period. She was discharged on that basis.

x) No risk assessment was recorded on the 2208 March 2018 or the 28
March 2018 after the medical reviews and no formal risk assessments
‘were undertaken,

sx.) Mary was under the care of the Home Treatment Team from the 28""
March 2018 to the 26% April 2018, On the 30 March 2018 she
stopped taking medication and expressed suicidal ideation, Her case
‘was discussed at the multidseiplinary team meetings on the 3"" April
2018 and the 17 April 2018 which include junior doctors. It was
unclear which consultant psychiatrist was responsible for her care at
that ime,

xii) Despite a request by one of the junior doctors to change her
‘medication on the 17° April 2018 this was refused by one of the
psychiatrists a the Abraham Cowley Unit. Mary was not medically
reviewed prior to this decision being taken,

xii.) Payment for the Travel Lodge was extended until the 2° April 2021

Tf-was sill unclear at that tage ifshe was eligible for housing so she
returned to her sister's home until the matter was resolved,

xiv) Mary was found eligible for housing and given temporary housing,

‘out of area in Feltham on the 19% April 2020. The Home Treatment
‘Team discharged her to the community team on the 24% April 2018.
There was no discharge planning meeting withthe care co-ordinator.
The Care Programme Approach was not followed,

xv) Mary was seen on the 24% April 2018 by her care co-ordinator, he

took an emergency supply of her medication with him, She sought a
‘medical review and it was requested by the care coordinator on the
1 May 2018,

xvi) Mary was not seen for a medical review prior to her death on the

26 May 2018, She did not organise or collect a repeat prescription of
her medication from the general practitioner in Surrey so would have
been without medication prior to her death. Her care coordinator did
not see her for 35 days before she died.

vil) On the 26 May 2018 she stepped out in front on an oncoming train

at Weybridge Station and died from the catastrophic injuries she
sustained,

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to
concern. In my opinion there isa risk that future deaths could occur unless
action is taken, In the circumstances i is my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ~

1

Mary was discharged from the Abraham Cowley Unit without a
discharge planning meeting taking place in circumstances where there
‘was no confirmation that she was eligible for housing provision and
‘with no plan was to what would happen after the Travel Lodge
placement ended. There is no policy in place which prevents a
vulnerable patient being discharged into homelessness from the
Abraham Cowley Unit

Mary was not subject to a medical review from the 25% March 2018 to the
26 May 2018, There is no policy in place which mandates when or if
patient should be subject to face to face review by a consultant

pay chiatrist after discharge from the acute unit

3. No formal risk assessment was undertaken of Mary and no risk
assessment was recorded in her records prior to her discharge from the
Abraham Cowley Unit

4, The informal risk assessments undertaken in the Abraham Cowley Unit
prior to her discharge failed to place any weight on the impact on Mary
of a discharge with an inchoate plan for her housing and arrived at an
incorrect assessment of her risk. The risk assessments were not
sufficiently rigorous and evidence based.

5, Mary was prematurely discharged from the Abraham Cowley Unit,
suffering from severe depression and before sufficient time had been
taken to observe the effectiveness of her prescribed medication. This
appears in part to have been because the imperative to discharge
patients took precedence over adequate discharge planning and
assessment. The CPA (“ Care Programme Approach"") was not followed,

6, Mary was discharged from the Home Treatment team on ineffective
‘medication and without any coherent plan for her care in the
‘community. Her care coordinator was not involved in the discharge
planning, The CPA was not followed.

7. The fact that she was placed out of area made it difficult for her to
participate in community based treatment and significantly impacted on
the ability of her care coordinator and community psychiatrist to

support her. There is no poliey which governs how often a patient
should be seen once in the community in order to review the risk

assessment and monitor compliance with medication,

| ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe
your organisation has the power to take such action,

‘5 CORONER'S CONCERNS
‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of mators of concern)

1. Evidence was heard that medical records and other important information could not be uploaded
tothe Trusts electronic nates system - PARIS when received in PDF form. This meant staff had to
preci notes onto the syslam, in this case when one person was working alone, on a nightshift was
Fequied to do this whist dealing with a variety of different tasks. Important dacuments that cannot
otto be uploaded immediately and in their ginal form concerns me that atlnding cnicians do
‘ot have access to these documents and can be hindered in making clinical decisions without
them

2. tbecame apparent on the evidence thal whilst Trust sta were working in premises operated by
‘nother Trust in his caze, County Dutham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust- CDDFT) they
auld not print medical nates and ether documents from the TEWWV IT system onto prints in
‘shared’ promises such as the AE Deparment of the CDDFT. This again meant important,
documents ean be unable to be shared with staff underlaking such tasks a= Mental Health
‘Assessments,

3. The Trust (TEWY) in evidence heard thatthe Elm Ward at West Park Hospital had been
Surveyed for issues rlated to patient safety such as ligature points. Whilst the evidence was that
the Trust was confident his had bean done, no assurance could be given. One such assessment
‘id not show clearly the deceased's bedroom had been inspected for isues such as bate
points

4. Evidence was heard that within the Durham & Dartington area ofthe TEWY Trust funding had
been secured forthe post ofa Bed Manager, who was to manage bed allocation, tanster and
ischarges to better manage access fo beds for patents across this area ofthe Durham &
DDaringlon area of te Trust. Iwas heard this role would be able to more proactively arrange
transfers of patents from Trust o Trust as was a naed raised inthis inquest. was disclosed that
this post only operated inthe Durham & Darlington area ofthe Trust and not across the whole

thet; however patent care remains the responsibilty of PRH. SPFT have reviewed ther
practice so that a contemporaneous note oftheir conautation ls copied from Carenotes and
placed In the A&E paper notes. Evidence from a PRH witnezs atthe Inquest confirmed that
Fir Costello's paper notes should have been updated every 2-3 hours to provide an accurate
‘account of how he was progressing. The witness indicated thatthe notes themselves which
RH staff use (paper notes) needed updating and reviewing. This had been done previously
for the PRH but then discarded following review by a Senior Nurse at the A&E department
‘t Royal Sussex County Hospital which is also run by the same Trust

| jumped from Union Street bridge in Newport, South Wales and injured his

| legs: He underwent a psychiatric assessment at which time he denied any

| suicidal attempt and that he had slipped when drunk. A further assessment

| revealed that whist Rory had no obvious immediate sicidl intent, of concern
| was the fet that he showed no remorse fr his ations.

| on a1 august Rory discharged himself from hospital. Me underwent a social

| care assessment at which ime twas confirmed that Rory needed to her
homes but there was no further involvement in Rory’ care from the adult
Disability seam. Furthermore Rory was net flowed up by community mental
health teams

Tris obvious that Rory was vulnerable and yet there was no statutory
‘monitoring arranged because he did not fll squarely into a box of social,
physical or mental health

Rory continued to ruminate over ending his ite

At about Sam on 9/10/18. Rorys father entered his son’s bedroom and.
discovered that Rory had died. Emergency services were called but Rory could
‘not be revived and the paramedics confirmed his death at 05:25 hours.

[A post mortem examination concluded that Rory had suffered an acute cardiac
‘event and that Rory had in his blood Ef MOMA normally
consumed for recreational purposes. In the absence of any underlying cardiac
pathology the pathologists opinion was that the cardiac death has on balance
‘been caused by the consumption of an excessive quantity of MDMA.

Following the inquest an internal investigation was undertaken, by Aneurin
Bevan University Health Board and recommendations were made in relation to
‘more cohesive working practices between partner agencies.

twas asked about how proctces had changed Smee ROMS death, Dm

T CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest, evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In
‘my opinion there isa rsk that future deaths will occur unless ation is taken In the
circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN areas follows:

‘The purpose of undertaking a Serious Untoward Incident investigation, isto identify
‘necessary organisational changes which can improve the outcomes for patients and
hopefully prevent future deaths. Rory had been discharged from acute services and
\was unde the care of his General Practitioner. n keeping with many people he had
‘been involved with different arms of ABU (primary, acute and psychiatric) He had
‘been involved with socal services.

After his death the charity MIND wrote to me and expressed concerns that Rory had
fallen between gaps in services. This was addressed in the internal investigation
undertaken by ABUHB, however itis surprising that his GP was not involved in this
‘aview and OF MD told me that GPs ae rarely asked to participate in these
Investigations.

In order that lessons can be learned and opportunities identified for better
partnership working around patients, it would seem appropriate thatthe patient's

primary care contact (especialy when being supervised in the community) be
involved in internal / serious incident reviews.

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action shouldbe taken to prevent future deaths and | believe you have
‘the power to take such action.

investigation and ensure that General Practitioners (and indeed any other relevant

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(On 15 May 2020 | commenced an investigation into the death of Azra Parveen HUSSAIN also
known as Azra Parveen Sultan. The investigation concluded at the end of a 6 day inquest on the
‘22nd March 2021. The conclusion of the inquest was ‘Suicide’ and the jury also answered a set of
{questions which identify that they conciuded:

1. On the 24th March 2020 there was a missed opportunity to commence ECT treatment and
itis kely hat Azra's death would have been prevented if she had undergone ECT.

2. On the 6th May 2020 there was a foreseeable risk that Azra would attempt suicide, that risk
had not been adequately identified by those caring for her, adequate measures had not
been taken to mitigate her risk and with adequate measures itis likely that Azra’s death
would have been prevented

3. On the 6th May 2020 there was a foreseeable risk that the en-suite bathroom door would
be used as a ligature point, adequate measures had not been taken to mitigate the risk and)
with adequate measures its likely that Azra's death would have been prevented.

(CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

(On the 6! May 2020 Azra was found at approx 18:25 hours hanging from her en-suite
bathroom door in room 14 on Ward 2 of Mary Seacole House having used her bedding to
‘create a noose. Mary Seacole House is operated and staffed by Birmingham and Solihull
‘Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust (‘BSMHT)). Azra had been detained there on 26""
December 2019 under section 2 of the Mental Health Act. She was on 15 minute
‘observations and was last recorded as being seen at 18:09 when she was on her bed. An
‘ambulance was called at 18:25 and arrived at 18:32. Staff had already cut Azra down and
‘started CPR. She could not be resuscitated and was declared deceased at 19:38.

Following a post mortem the medical cause of death was determined to be:

(CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving ise to concem. In my
fopinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action Is taken. In the circumstances itis
Imy statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

1. On the 4th May 2020 Azra's mother and daughter had been in telephone contact
with the nurse in charge on the ward expressing concerns that Azra had messaged
them to say she had attempted suicide using shoelaces as a ligature. The nurse
‘spoke to Azra who denied making a ligature, Azra's neck was examined and she
had no marks from ligature use. The shoelaces from one pair of shoes were
removed but other shoelaces, clothing and bedding were left in her possession as it
was felt that Azra was not at an immediate risk. She was not believed to be at
immediate risk because, whilst it was a feature of her mental state common to
many patients that she would regularly talk about not wanting to live and requesting
‘an overdose, there was no evidence that she had made an active suicide attempt
land she had no history of suicide or seltharm attempts. The fact that she was now
‘saying that she had attempted to make ligature was a change in her presentation
(her previous suicidal ideation had centred around requesting assistance to
‘overdiose), it was also of significance that she was saying one thing to her family
‘and something different to a clinician. BSMHT accepted that the information was
significant and therefore there ought to have been consideration of it by her treating
team with a review of her risk and observation levels. However, no record at all was
made ofthe family's concems and the account given by Azra. Her risk screen was
not updated, an incident report was not raised, and the information was not
included in handover to the next shift or at the next MDT on the 6th May. Therefore,
itwas not considered at an MDT meeting on the 6th May 2020. Due to the
‘COVID19 pandemic Azra's family could not attend that meeting and raise their
concerns direcly. Microsoft Teams was used by some clinicians to attend the MDT
fon the 6th May but was not made available to Azra's family nor was a telephone
number to dial into the meeting, BSMHT has put in a system for a form to be
‘completed in advance of an MDT which requires the family’s input to be sought,
placed on the form and considered in the MDT. Itis my concern that ths is
‘equivalent to the family being included in the meeting (prior to COVID families were
invited to attend MDTs): there is the potential that information will not be recorded
accurately or will not be understood in written form, it also doesn't afford family the
‘opportunity to hear the plan arising from the meeting and provide their views. There:
is no reason why attendance by a remote platform or telephone line at the meeting
itself cannot be offered to family forall MDT.

2. BSMHT had risk assessed ward 2 for ligature points, including the en-suite
bathrooms, in November 2019. The en-suite bathroom doors were given the
highest risk score possible on an acute ward, but no corrective action was identified
to remove or mitigate the risk: the risk assessment relied on clinical assessment
and observation of the service user to mitigate the risk. Evidence was given at the
inquest that pressure sensor alarms have been available in the UK from numerous
manufacturers for 10 years, BSMHT had been investigating and testing different
pressure sensor alarms for en-suite bathroom doors for approximately 2 years
before Azra's death. BSMHT has now identified an appropriate pressure sensor for
‘en-suite bathroom doors and the en-suite bathroom door of room 14 on ward 2 was.

replaced in November 2020 with a door incorporating a pressure sensor alarm.
BSMHT has a 17 month program to fit pressure sensor alarms to all en-suite
bathroom doors within its inpatient units. However, this is not being considered for
‘other doors within the bedroom area nor is there any national requirement for in-
patient mental health units to place, or consider placing, pressure sensor alarms on.
doors within areas where patients are afforded privacy and time alone. | am
‘concerned that within BSMHT's inpatient units there will be a continuing risk from
‘other doors in the bedroom area (including the main bedroom door) even when the
‘en-suite bathroom doors are fitted with pressure sensor alarms. Although the outer
face of a bedroom door will be on a communal corridor, service users on level 1
and 2 observations will have periods where they are unobserved in their rooms and
‘could wedge a ligature at the top of a door so that it wasn't obviously visible from
outside. Furthermore, in the absence of any national regulations or guidance on
this topic the risk from en-suite and other doors in areas where service users spend
time unobserved will persist in mental health units operated by other Trusts and
private providers around the country.

‘ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN
In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe:
11) BSMHT have the power to take such action in relation to issues 1 and 2 above; and

2) the Care Commissioning Group for Birmingham and Solihull, Care Quality Commission and the
Health and Safety Executive have the power to take such action in relation to issue 2 above.

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

On 14 October 2020, one of my assistant coroners, Edwin Bucket,
‘commenced an investigation into the death of Grazyna Walczak, aged
61 years.

‘The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest earlier today. |

unless action is taken. In the circumstances, itis my statutory duty to

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.

1. Ms Walezak was seen by a psychological wellbeing practitioner
from the Camden and Islington iCope service two or three days
before her death. She was assessed as being at low to moderate
risk to herselt

However, she was not asked if she would agree to her family
being notified of the situation and of her current mental ill health
Her son would dearly ike to have been told what was happening
and would have acted accordingly

heard evidence that iCope does not routinely ask their patients
if families may be involved. This seems to be a policy worthy of
reconsideration,

2. The 72 hour investigation report that should be produced within
72 hours of death, to enable fast learning that may be of
immediate benefit to other patients, was not completed until last
week, some five months after Ms Walczak’s death,

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(On 3 September 2020, | commenced an investigation into the death of
Jaden Francois-Esprit, aged 21 years. The investigation concluded at
the end of the inquest on 15 February 2021. | made a determination of
suicide.

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Jaden hanged himself at home on the 25'* or 26"" of August 2020. In the
last few weeks of his life he became more withdrawn, including at his
place of work as a firefighter. He fel isolated, though in reality he had
friends there and was welliked, as well as being loved by his family,

CORONER'S CONCERNS.

During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving
rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur
unless action is taken. In the circumstances, itis my statutory duty to
report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.

Unbeknown to those with whom he worked at Wembley Fire Station,
Jaden's mental well being was deteriorating significantly in the last
weeks of his life, and it deteriorated to the point where he killed himselt

| heard at inquest that the London Fire Brigade has quite sophisticated
systems in place to support firefighters suffering mental ill health
However, Jaden was not offered the support of, for example,
psychological counselling, because it was not appreciated that he was
0 very low.

Obviously if firefighters are to be given the best chance of recovering
from mental il health, their dificlties first need to be recognised.

| appreciate that it can be dificult to detect that a person may be
depressed or exceptionally unhappy. Signs may be subtle and require a
‘nuanced approach.

‘+ Jaden often complained that he was bored because Wembley Green
Watch had not been called to many incidents. | heard evidence that
boredom in a new firefighter can be quite common. However, | also
heard that a complaint of boredom can be a sign of a person with
dyslexia avoiding an unpalatable or daunting task.

+ Jaden had dyslexia and was worried that he would not be able to
complete his written work in order to become a fully qualified
firefighter, yet the reality was that his station officer was fully aware
of his difficulties and had tried to reassure Jaden that he was
certainly capable of achieving his goal.

‘+ He did need extra time, the space to make mistakes and a degree of
sensitivity that was not always alforded him. On the other hand, he
asked for help and was given a mentor, but did not make use of him
land so eventually the mentorship ceased. That request for help
followed by a refusal of help was not explored. Such an exploration
might have led to a greater understanding of how Jaden could be
helped.

‘+ Jaden felt he was being treated unfairly at work and his family have
formed the view that there was an element of racism there, driven in
part by their belief that Jaden was the only non white person on
Wembley Green Watch. Yet the reality was that he joined a watch
where a quarter ofthe firefighters were people of colour.

‘+ He described being teased about bringing chicken, rice and peas to
work to eal, thinking that this teasing was because the food was
Caribbean. Looking at this from the outside, chicken, rice and peas
seems a dish without obvious world origin. Moreover, | heard about
huge variety of food being brought to work by firefighters, with
some even weighing their food before eating. None of this sits easily
with a dish of chicken, rice and peas resulting in a racist comment.

Jaden's interior life did not always accord with what was going on around
him. Most of all he felt isolated, and yet it was clear to me that he there
was a lot of affection for him at the fire station. He did not always feel
comfortable there. It is not necessarily an easy task to unearth such
feelings in a colleague but, if it results in such a tragedy as this being
avoided, itis a worthwhile one.

| should be grateful if you, or whoever you delegate to investigate this
matter, would listen to the entirety of the recording of this inquest. The
London Fire Brigade investigation report already produced, talks in some
detail about the station culture, There were so many different aspects to
the evidence that, without listening to the whole inquest, | am afraid that
any understanding will not be as meaningful as it could be.

3 | CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS
I make this report under paragraph 7(1) of Schedule 5 to The Coroners
and Justice Act 2009.

4 INQUEST
The inquest into the death of Michael Dent-Jones was opened on 5
February 2019 following an investigation which was commenced on 30
July 2018. The inquest was resumed on 4 February 2021 and the
conclusion was handed down on 5 February 2021

The medical cause of Mr Dent-Jones’s death was:

la. Tramadol Toxicity
2. Coronary Artery Disease

The inquest concluded with a short-from conclusion of ‘Drug-Related
Death’ and a Narrative Conclusion as set out below.

“Drug-Related Death,

The Approved Premises Manual 2014 (Version 2), which was in force at
the time and remains in force, sates that residents in Approved Premises
should not be allowed to collect their prescribed medication themselves.

The Approved Premises Manual requires each Approved Premises to
have a system in place so that the residents’ prescribed medication can be
provided directly to staff at the Approved Premises.

There was a failure on the part of the National Probation Service, contrary
to the Approved Premises Manual, to set up such a system at St.
Catherine’s Priory and as a result Mr Dent-Jones was able to gain access to
his Tramadol prescription which he then overdosed on resulting in his
death’

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH.

(On 10 March 1994 Mr Dent-Jones received a life sentence with a minimum.
term of 12 years.

Whilst he was in prison he was suspected of misusing alcohol and
prescription and illicit drugs.

(On 27 September 2017 Mr Dent-Jones was released on licence to an
Approved Premises in Brighton run by the National Probation Service.

(On 2 November 2017 he was recalled to prison for breaching the
conditions of his licence, due to a pattern of alcohol and deug misuse
‘hich culminated in his admission to hospital due to suspected illicit
drug use.

(On 15 November 2017, whilst Mr Dent-Jones’ was in prison, his
prescription for Tramadol, which was prescribed in relation to chronic
back pain, was stopped by the healthcare team due to concerns that he
‘was pretending to swallow the tablets when they were dispensed to him
but was in fact concealing them.

(On 9 July 2018 Mr Dent-Jones was again released on licence, on this
occasion to St Catherine’s Priory, an Approved Premises in Guildford,
also run by the National Probation Service.

On his arrival at St.Catherine’s Priory, Mr Dent-Jones was assessed as not
being suitable to keep his medication in his own possession due to his
history of drug abuse and he agreed to hand in his prescribed medication
tostaft

(On 11 July 2018 Mr Dent-Jones registered at Dapdune House GP Surgery
in Guildford and requested a prescription of Tramadol for long standing,
back pain. He informed the prescribing GP that he had been taking.
Tramadol for many years and that he got withdrawal symptoms if he did
not take it. The records available to the prescribing GP at the time
confirmed that Mr Dent-Jones had had a long-term prescription for
Tramadol. However, the prescribing GP was not aware that Mr Dent-
Jones had a history of drug abuse or that his prescription of Tramadol had
been stopped in November 2017 due to concerns that he had been
concealing the tablets. Accordingly, a prescription of MH Tramadol
tablets was issued to Mr Dent-Jones and Mr Dent-Jones subsequently
collected the prescription from Dapdune House Pharmacy.

Mr Dent-Jones did not inform staff at St Catherine's Priory that he had
obtained the Tramadol tablets or hand them in,

On 14 July 2018 Mr Dent-Jones was found deceased in his bed at St
Catherine's Priory, having last been known to be alive at approximately
Tipm the night before.

Mr Dent-Jones’ death was caused by an unintentional overdose of
Tramadol, and contributed to by his Coronary Artery Disease, which
reduced his cardiac reserve,

The inquest concluded with the following short-form and narrative
conclusion as set out in Box 4 above.

CORONER'S CONCERNS

The Coroner's concerns are as follows:

During the course of the inquest the court heard the following evidence:

The National Probation Service Approved Premises Manual 2014
requires Approved Premises to put in place a local procedure for
the collection/delivery of residents’ prescribed medication. The
residents are not to be permitted to collect it themselves;

In December 2018 the National Probation Service introduced the
Safe Working Practices Document which sets out NPS policies and
procedures in relation to various aspects of resident safety. Each
Approved Premises is required to adapt the document to include
their local procedure in respect of the delivery/collection of
residents’ prescribed medication. Each Approved Premises is also
required to maintain a Register confirming that every member of,
staffhas read and understood the Safe Working Practices
Document for the particular Approved Premises they work in.
However, the Area Manager for Approved Premises in Surrey,
Sussex and Bedfordshire gave evidence that prior to the inquest
she had not previously been aware of the requirement to set up a
system for the delivery/collection of prescribed medication as set
ut in the Approved Premises Manual 2014 and she had not
previously seen a copy of the Safe Working Practices Document
2o18.

The witness also gave evidence that until very recently there had
not been no procedure in place for the collection/delivery of
residents’ prescribed medication at St. Catherine's Priory in
Guildford or at the Approved Premises in Brighton.

The National Probation Service was unable to provide the court
with a copy of the Safe Working Practices Document for St
Catherine's Priory.

St. Catherine's Priory does not have a Register confirming that
every member of staff had read and understood the Safe Working
Practices Document.

Accordingly Iam concerned that

= Staff at St Catherine's Priory Approved Premises in Guildford, as
well as staff in other Approved Premises nationally, may not be
familiar with, or applying, the guidance set out in the Safe Working.
Practices Document in relation to the delivery/collection of
residents’ prescribed medication, but also more generally in
relation to the other policies and procedures pertaining to resident
safety in that document.

The MATTER OF CONCERN is:

= Staff at St Catherine's Priory Approved Premises in Guildford, as
well as staff in other Approved Premises nationally, may not be
familiar with, or applying, the guidance set out in the Safe Working.
Practices Document in relation to the delivery/collection of
residents’ prescribed medication, but also more generally in
relation to the other policies and procedures pertaining to resident
safety in that document.

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN
In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I
believe that the people listed in paragraph one above have the power to
take such action.

YOUR RESPONSE
You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of its date; 1
‘may extend that period on request.

‘Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be
taken, setting out the timetable for such action. Otherwise you must

home Address (EEN suspended from a ligature.

The inquest heard that Robert Hardy had mental health issues
in the months preceding his death. On 25"" July he had
reported an attempt to take his life to GMP and had been taken
to hospital by Police Officers. On 30"" July he had reported an
alleged assault to GMP involving a male he named and
involving a weapon.

The inquest heard that officers did not visit him to take an
account and he was not signposted to any support services.
The assault was not recorded as a crime by GMP until after his

victim given his recent history. The inquest heard that in the

the text message but ended the call.

The evidence before the inquest was that GMP had not
recorded the assault with a weapon as a crime within the crime

3 | INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(On 25"" November 2019 | commenced an investigation into the
death of Carole Mitchell. The investigation concluded on the 3""
February 2021 and the conclusion was one of suicide.

The medical cause of death was
1a) Diltiazem toxicity on background of hypertensive heart
disease

4 | CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Carole Mitchell had a long history of involvement with mental
health services, including being sectioned under the Mental
Health Act and periods of voluntary admission at mental health
units. Between 2017 and 2019, she was an inpatient on six
occasions. She had three reported attempts to take her own
life between 2017 and 2019.

Throughout her time with Mental Health Services, she was
reluctant to have information shared with her family. Her family
were concerned about her deterioration. In 2019 however
attempts by them to share information were not actively
pursued by Mental Health Services and as a result information
gathering that would have assisted in assessing her was
limited.

She was transferred from the Home-Based Treatment Team
(HBTT) to the Community Mental Health Team (CMHT) on

18th April 2019. There was a clear conflict in the understanding
between the two teams regarding her care plan at handover,
which was not recognised by either team. Following transfer to
the care of the CMHT, she was seen less often. This was not
fully detailed, or risk assessed.

On 23th April 2019, it was decided Carole Mitchell would
benefit from psychological assessment and she was added to
the Secondary Care Psychology waiting list. The first
appointment was 21st November 2019. The delay was due to
a lack of appointments for that service.

It was identified she would benefit from a support worker to
work alongside the care co-ordinator. The first support worker's
relationship was unsuccessful, and a decision was taken she
should be replaced. There was a three month wait for a
replacement support worker. There was no formal escalation to
seek to prioritise Carole Mitchell, although it was clear the
support service would be beneficial to helping her with her
mental health

(On 8th October 2019, her husband told mental health services
that she had attempted to take an overdose on 6th October
2019. Following that disclosure, her case was not red zoned by
her care co-ordinator and there was no face to face
assessment to identify if any additional strategies would assist
in supporting her or reducing risk.

On 22nd November 2019, her husband left home at about
6:45am. He returned home to J! IIE. Sale at
about 6:15pm. He found Carole Mitchell unresponsive on the
floor in the main bedroom. Police enquiries found no
suspicious circumstances or evidence of third-party
involvement in her death. There was no note or message
found. Her medication was found by her bedside.

Post-mortem examination, including toxicology, found that she
had died from a fatal amount of her prescribed medication.

CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters
giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future
deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it
is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —
1. The inquest heard that psychology assessment and

therapies can be very beneficial to those with mental
health issues in secondary services as well as primary
services. The evidence given was that the delay that Mrs
Mitchell experienced in accessing that service was
reflective of both the regional and national backlog for
appointments. The inquest was told that the position had
worsened since 2019 and for example someone in Mrs
Mitchell's position today would be more likely to wait 9
months than the 7 months in 2019.

2. Mrs Mitchell on two occasions could not be
accommodated locally when an inpatient stay was
required. The evidence heard at the inquest was that this
was due to limited national mental health bed capacity
against the demand within mental health services. The
inquest heard evidence that suggested that this impacted
on how she could be supported by her family and overall
care.

3. It was accepted at the inquest that information gathering
from family could be beneficial. However, there was a
reluctance by health professionals to fully utilise
information gathering due to concerns about breaching
patient confidentiality. This appeared to stem from a
misunderstanding between the concept of information
sharing and information gathering and how they inter
related with the principle of patient confidentiality.

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths
and I believe you have the power to take such action.

You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS.

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed a matter giving rise to concern. In my
opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the
circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows.

The hanging incident occurred after prison lockdown. Shortly prior to this the electricity
Supply for the sockets in the cell had tripped. Mike had used his cell bell to call a prison
officer and he was told it would be sorted out but probably not until the next day. The inquest
also heard that in some cases (not Mike's) that cell ights will trip and this tends to take out
four cells. tis also possible that other damage may be caused to cells. | am aware that
there are very limited staff and security concems following lockdown. If however prisoners
‘become aware that remedial action may not take place unti the following day this does
provide a potential (either deliberate or accidental) for prisoners to harm themselves. |
wonder if itis possible for some form of basic maintenance to be available during lockdown
hours. f this concem appears more to be a national one rather than a local one then please
{feel free to pass it on to whoever itis appropriate to deal with it,

On the 11%, 12, 16, and 27” November 2020, evidence was heard touching the
‘death of Valeria Andrea MUNOZ BIGGS a Inner West London Coroner's Court She
had died on 20"" September 2019 attr jumping infront of a tran at Holland Park
Underground Station. Sho was 31 years old at he ime of her death,

Medical Cause of Death
1 (a) Multiple Injuries

How, when, where Ms Munoz Biggs came by her death:

(On 20"" September 2018, Valeria jumped in ron of @ Westbound train at Holland Park
‘Staion at approximately 13:20. She was kiled instantly. She had suffered wth affective
dsordersines age 18 years and had received treatment for hi successtuly in Chil,
including in tho Spring of 2018.

In September of 2019 she developed an exacerbation of her symptoms. She contacted
her psychiatrist who recommended increasing quetiapine fo I and restarting
clonazepam which had previously assisted

(On 1219/2019 she was actively euicidal and sought help on the advice of her psychiatrist
(of NHS services. Ill attended, which in turn spake tothe Single Point of Access for
‘West London Mental Health Trt. Her eymploms were not taken suilenty seriously.

‘She attended A&E where she was found by Liason Psychiatry to be mentally unwell and
‘admission was discussed. She was concemed about admission and so wae reerred to
the CRISIS Home Treatment Team, with a recommendation fr low tweshold or
‘admission i her risk escalated or her family were not coping. She was dected to Care
in the Community by the Home Treatment Team.

‘Overnight she was activaly suicidal, attending a train station with thoughts of jumping
before a tran. This continued the next day. The Home Treaiment Team dd not vist on

1a Seplember 2079 as planned and dd not assess her sucdally or speak wih the
family, despite a contact ram police that afternoon. informing them that a member ot
pubic had found her wandering expressing a wish to take her own ie. find this to be
{705s Faure onthe part ofthe Trust.

‘Suicidal thoughts continued especialy on the 15% September 2019. These were
Lnderestimated by the visting team.

By the 15% Septomber 2018, she had let the flat with the intention to take her own lite
(on four occasions. The family were unable to keep her safe

‘There were delays in psychiatric assessment, flue o increase her drugs adequately
‘and persistent underestimation of her suicidality and falure to adequately engage with
{and Isten othe family and note their concerns.

“There was team culture of postive risk taking,

I she had been adequately assessed and admitted to hospital, her death would not
have occurred at this time.

Conclusion of the Coroner as to the death:

Valeria took her own life whilst suffering agitated depression possibly on the
Dipolar spectrum, Her death was conteibuted to by neglect

‘Exiensive evidence was fakenin cour.

‘The findings on the Record of Inquest, as set out above, in many ways highight

In Aditi:

“There wore concerns about the credbiliyof some ofthe evidence given by the Trust
witnesses, and the ably ofthe Trust to reflect upon and learn lessons from this death

“There was a repeated theme of lack engagoment with thse attempting to care for
Valeria at home: a lack of support fr her carers; not recording cancers raised by
carers; spectcaly missing opportunities to make a full informed assessment of
Valeria’ isk of suicide; missing opportunites to be updated about her past psychiatric
history te

Valeria was not propery offered admission to hospital, bu rather pushed toward care in
the communty and this decision was naver revised during the episode of care despite
the dificules in manging her safety at home; her lack of improvement and even

apparent worsering: Rr strong family history of polar affecive dsorder and the strong
possibilty that ths was her underlying diagnosis; and her active risk of suicidality which
‘was over to her family andthe non NHS psychiatrist who was approached bythe family.

‘Comments of a personal nature ware made to her: paraphrased as “you are so pretty
‘why would you want 0 kil yourse, by a male member ofthe team ina cumsy attempt
to cheer her up which she and her boyfriend who was present found offensive.

Lack of proper assessment of suicidality for example: seeming to ignore her actions, and
concoms passed by her brother who was caring for her and over relance upon no active
‘Suicidaly being expressed when directly asked. Even when she was al times so unwell
that she would not falk or was incoherent there wae no reassessment of isk.

Issues wih planned visits not aking place.

[A stated culture by senior sta of postive risk taking in relation to suicidality.

\When her family in desperation sought advice from other psychiatrists, one of whom
made an extensive telephone assessment of Valera, and passed on the concerns trom
these professionals fo the treating team, these were seemingly ignored in that here was
no reassessment of risk, no change in ealment and no admission considered, nor even
proper recording in the medical record.

Despite the seriousness of har nial assessment in ARE, her past history, her family
history and the potential for her to have a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, she was never
personaly assessed by an NHS consultant psychiatist in tis inal episode ot lines.

‘She was not treated in ine with BNF guidelines.
[A inding of tact was made that had her family been able to take her home to Chile the

‘death would licly have been avoided at this time due to the allerent approach to
treatment here

‘Concams of the Caroner=
1. That the Trust has a culture of ek aking in relation to suicidality

2. Thal the Trust staff need training in elation to assessment of suicide risk
how to engage with families and carers, nat o use nappropyiale personal

3. That where appropriate admiesion should be considered to diagnose, and

4. That patonts should be treated in ine with BNF guidance

into his death was commenced. The investigation concluded at the and othe inquest on
21 January 2021. The jury found thatthe medical cause of Me ORourke's death was
hanging. Ther conclusion was that he died by suicide to which a series of acors possibly
canttbsied, as explained luther under secton 4 below.

| CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Jason ORoutke ded in his single occupancy cellon House Block 3 in HMP Belmarsh at
‘some point between 7.28 pm on the 18 Api 2019 and when he was found at 8.33 am on
22 Apri 2019, hanging fram the window bars in his call using a ligature made from a
bedsheet. He had clear been dead for some time.

No one had entered Mr O'Rourke's cell overnight. The rll checks scheduled to take
place at 9.00 pm an the night of 1 Ape 2019 and 6.00 am onthe morning of 2 Apri
2ot9 had not been caried out, although it cannat be said that had those checks been
‘done, the auicome would have been any ferent

Prior to his death Mr O'Rourke had chosen to sel-isoate in his cel. The jury found that
[Mr O Rourke’ suicide was possbly contributed to be the following factors:

(The serious fluro to take turer stops with respect to Mr ORourke's mental heath
ater the Primary Cara Mental Healt Nurse's attempt to tage him on & March
2ar9;

(@) The fact that healthcare staf didnot provide suficint information about Me
(O'Rourke's mental haath to prison staf during the month that he was resident on}
House Block 2:

(a) The fact that prison stat on the wing didnot have sulicient understanding of Mr
(OFRourke's mental heath history and his Pistory of sol-harm from (a) information
Feceived rom healtheare b) the information an the Cal Sharing Rik

() The fac that he Safety inerventon Meetings in March 2019 were an inadequat|
way ot adaressing the Issue of self isolaton and risk in elaton to Mr O Rout

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of he inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In
my opinion there is arsk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. Inthe
Creumstancesitis my statutory duty to repor to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN ate as faliows.

(1) The ‘immediate needs’ form completed for prisoners on arival al HMP Belmarsh
oes no faciitate a clear assessment of any risk of sel-harm or suicide and the
fetons to be taken f such a risk i enified,

‘The form poses a question: “is there any speciic concems re salam or
suicide?’ and then gives the guidance “Il yes, amend care plan"". However. this
{guidance is only elfecive for those prisaners who already have a care plan.
‘meaning those who are already on an open Assessment, Care in Cusiody and
‘Teamwork (ACCT) plan. The action fo be taken for those prisoners where
speciic concerns regarding sellharm or suicide are identified, but who do not
aeady have a care plan, fs unclear rom the frm.

Itis also unclear how the above question interacts with futher questions below it
which address any past ACCTS/FZ052SHs, the level of support available tothe
prisoner and the answer the prisoner gives tothe question ""Do you fee! suicidal

‘Accordingly, this form does not suticienty highight prisoners who are in fac
Suieidal or where there are concer about ther risk of sel-harm or suicidal,
those on the wing

(2) The nighty roll checks at HMP Belmarsh are due to be cartied out by a sing!
‘member of Operational Suppor Grade (OSG) staf at 9.00 pm and 6.00 am. Theil
Stated purpose isto check for escape or death among the prisoners. On hangin
Cover to the morring staf, the OSG signs paperwork indicating thal the rol check
hhave been completed. There is no robust system by which the prison management
audit this process. This means thatthe prison management can be under thd
impression thatthe checks have been carried out, when they have not been, a

4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH
Michael Jonathan Woods died at Southampton Hospital on 9th October 2019. Mr Woods had
been admitted to Southampton Hospital on 8th October 2019 after using a rifle to shoot himself
while on a rifle range in Charmouth, where he was taking part in a shooting experience.

Mr Woods had contacted the Target Sports Centre (""the shooting range"") on 8th October 2019,
asking to arrange a tour of the site with a view to arranging a day out for his work colleagues.
When he attended that afternoon, he requested availability of a ""shooting experience” and was
told there was availability on the 25 metre range for one hour of shooting, supervised by a
qualified range officer. Mr Woods agreed, underwent a safety briefing and then proceeded to the
25 metre range together with one other participant and the range officer. It was towards the
fend of the hour of shooting, when, without warning, Mr Woods turned the rifle on himself.

Nr Woods’ death was investigated by the police and the Dorset Council Environmental Health
Department. Four recommendations were made to the shooting range by BL the
Environmental Health Officer investigating the death, All recommendations have been adopted
by the shooting range. In addition, oftheir own votion, the shooting range will no longer take
bookings from non-club members to shoot on the day they make the inquiry: bookings can only
be for the following or subsequent days to allow a ""cooling off"" period.

and Justice Act 2009.

3. | INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

The inquest into the death of Linda Gillchrest was opened on 3°
September 2020. It was resumed and concluded on 18"" December 2020.

The medical cause of Mrs Gillchrest’s death was:
1a, Sodium Nitrite Poisoning

The inquest concluded with a short form conclusion of:
Suicide.

| CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

(On the 19 July 2020 Linda Gillchrest was found by a neighbour in bed at
her home address in Guildford, Surrey, there were no signs of life. She
had not been seen for two days. The emergency services were called and

‘death was recognised at 23:31 hours that same day. A quantity of Sodium.
Nitrite, which Mrs Gillchrest had bought on-line, was found in the bin
situated in the kitchen at her home address. Toxicological tests found
high levels of Sodium Nitrite in her blood, which could not be explained
by diet. Further, Mrs Gillchrest had bought an ebook which gave detailed
and clear instructions as to how to self-administer a fatal dose of Sodium
Nitrite

5 | CORONER'S CONCERNS
During the course of the inquest, evidence was heard that in May 2019
Mrs Gillehrest bought an e-book online from the USA, titled The Peaceful
Pill eHandbook, from a website of the same name. The book gave very
clear and precise instructions as to how to self-administer a fatal dose of
Sodium Nitrite, including the amount required and a timeline to death.
In that same month, for less than £5:00, pounds, Mrs Gillchrest
purchased, on the auction site ‘www-ebay.co.uk’, a quantity of Sodium.
Nitrite that was in excess of that recommended in The Peaceful Pill
eHandbook as being required for a fatal dose.

Both purchases were made without any restriction being imposed by the
sellers.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are that:

‘+ A publication such as The Peaceful Pill Handbook, that contains
detailed instructions as to how to end a human life is available to
be purchased online without restriction

‘+ Soditum Nitrite is available to be purchased in lethal quantities
from a UK website for less than £5:00, again without restriction.

‘+ No protection is afforded to vulnerable people prior to them.
‘making such purchases.

Consideration should be given to whether any steps can be taken to
address the above concerns.

6 | ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN
In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I
believe that the people listed in paragraph one above have the power to
take such action.

7 | YOUR RESPONSE
You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of its date;
‘may extend that period on request.

‘Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be
taken, setting out the timetable for such action. Otherwise you must
explain why no action is proposed,

(On 187.2018 | commenced an investigation ino the death of CLAIRE LILLEY. aged 38,
‘The investigation concluded atthe end a the inquest on 30 November 2020. The
conclusion of he inquest, before a jury, was a naralve conclusion which, in summary,
‘was as follows:

Claire's medical cause of death wa
‘fa Hypoxic Brain inary
‘tb Hanging,

Claire died ae a result o injuries sustained by hanging hersel. While the main
Contributing factor leading to her hanging was her menial lines, on the ward, relevant
information was diffuse and there was no central formulation ofthe most pertinent
information relevant orsk. This became especialy relevant when several members of
‘Ward staff were on leave and there was insufficient management cover to review ik.

@_ | CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Claire was detained undersection 3 ofthe Mental Health Act and admit to Avery Ward
(0n 22 October 2018, via the Queen Elizabeth Hospital folowing a significant overdose.
During her admission she was dagoosed with a severe depression with psychotic
‘sympioms in November 2018 and an addtional agnosis of generalised anxiety disorder
in January 2018.

‘She commenced varius stages of ward leave in 2018 from accompanied to unescorted
Section 17 overnight leave to her home. The status ofthat home leave and the anxieties
she felt on leave varied. Claire gave a report to ward staff ha although there were

ficulties, overall the outcome was positive. (Clare's mother considored
thal certainly by the end of January early February 2018, those visits were not posive,
resulting in increased anxiety for Claire

“There was no direct contactor proactively sought feedback, by staff, certainly after the 6
February. On the 6” i attended the ward and fed back her increasingly
anxious views of home teaver A review on the th woul, in the opinion of the appointed
‘exper, have assisted in assessing her and was a missed opportunity. Itwas also
Confirmed that Clare's risk aseessmant was not discussed with mmm and Tere Was
no centralised document reviewing her risk ~ no formulation of at ask

(On 12 February, whist on Section 17 overnight leave, Claire hung hersl! at ome. She
was found by her mother. Despite futher measures, she sadly dd not survive.

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of he inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In
my opinion there isa risk thal future deaths could occur unless action is taken. Inthe
eumstances itis my statulory duty to repor to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

(1) Individuals who are the subject of detainment under the Mental Health Acta risk
‘assessed at numerous times. For those that are on Section 17 home leave, they are
additonal assessed prior to leaving the ward on each occasion. In addin, risks are
‘also reviewed onthe regular mult-disciplinary ward rounds.

(2) However, such assessments are not cantalised in any one place - there is no
Central formulation. Reviews by any clinician would have to cover 3 a 4 diferent entries
‘by way of example: the risk assessment page, the MOT note, the psychology entries
{although they per se, do not ener risks assessments)

(a) The Cours expert confirmed that such a centralisation formulation (supported by the
Route Cause Analysis report), would assist in reviewing an incvidua's sk and allowing
‘Ward staf to see the wider input mn one place

(@) Training has been implemented by the Trust to assist staff in formulating risk, a
process that was in place at the time of Claire's death. However. there is no central
repositoryilormulation ofthe outcomes of those assessments. Different teams continue
{oluse diferent ool; thare fs no sland alone document

(5) Consideration should therefore be given tothe creation of a centralised, formulate,

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

‘The death of Tina Murray on 8 January 2020 was reported to me and | opened an
Investigation, which concluded by way of an inquest held on 13% November 2020.

| determined that the medical use of Tina's death was 1a Suffocation,

Inbox 3 ofthe Record of Inquest | recorded as follows:
“Tina Murray had previously been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and had had
a history of self-harming behaviour. She resided in a care facility. Her presentation had
‘been stable for a number of months. After being spoken to by stoff during the morning
‘of 8"" January 2020 when no significant concerns were raised, Tina had a shower at
‘around 11 am and remained in her room until approximately 11.50 am when she was
{found by care staff to be lay on her back on her bed and unresponsive. Tina had a white
plastic bag which she had located in the care home secured over her head. Staff
_members immediately removed the bag and attempted cardio-pulmonary resuscitation
Paramedics were called and they transferred Tina to hospital where she was
pronounced deceased at 13:38 hours. A subsequent post mortem examination
Confirmed that Tina died due to suffocation. The risk that Tina may seek to harm herself
by gaining access toa plastic bag withthe intention of voluntarily suffocating herself in
‘order to end her life had not been fully recognized.”

‘The conclusion of the Coroner was that Tina Murray died due to Suleide.

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Tina Murray was not a detained patient although she did reside within a care

home reported to specialise in caring for clients with mental health conditions,

‘elderly cients, cients who suffer with dementia, and learning disabilities. She
was able to move around within the home and not confined to her coom.

*  Inaround June 2019, care staff witnessed Tina to be in possession of aplastic
bag and to infer that she may use the bag to harm herself. Staff were concerned
about this, and indeed it was established at the inquest that care staff were
reminded about this concern over subsequent months. However, | found that
Tina had been able to access a plastic bag from within the care home. Evidence
was received on the basis that the bag used by Tina had most likely been
obtained fram inside one ofthe bins located in the rooms of other residents

*Itappeared to me that should a resident be intent on locating aplastic bag from
within the home they would be able to do so and in Tina’s case with fatal
consequences.

+ Care staff were in my view placed in an impossible situation whereby on the one
had they were being reminded that Tina gaining access toa plastic bag may be a
concern but given that plastic bags were accessible within the building the risk
posed to Tina could not be guarded against.

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters
giving rise to concern. In my opinion there isa risk that future deaths could occur unless.
‘action is taken. Inthe circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The
MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

(2) Tina Murray posed a risk to herself, and specifically n relation to plastic bags,
yet plastic bags appear to have been accessible within the home;

(2) Belgravia Care Home looks after residents who may nat be detained but who do
suffer from mental health conditions, dementia, learning disabilities and itis
‘therefore important that risk assessments and safety measures in place at the
Belgravia Care Home are robust.

‘ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and | believe you,
Proprietors of Belgravia Care Ltd, have the power to take such action.

‘YOUR RESPONSE

You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report,

4 INQUEST
The inquest into the death of Kimberley Smith was opened on 19 March
2019. It was resumed on 9 November 2020 with a jury and concluded on
20 November 2020.

The medical cause of Miss Smith’s death was:

la, Plastic Bag Asphyxia

The inquest concluded with a short form conclusion of suicide and a
narrative conclusion which is set out below.

(CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Kimberley Smith had been diagnosed with Depression, Anorexia
Nervosa, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Emotional Unstable
Personality Disorder and had a history of alcohol dependency and self-
harm,

(On 20th September 2018, 29 September 2018 and 2 October 2018 she was
admitted to hospital following attempts to take her own life whilst under
the influence of alcohol.

(On 3 October 2018 Miss Smith was assessed under the Mental Health Act
and admitted as an informal patient to the Abraham Cowley Unit (ACU),
which is an inpatient psychiatric unit run by Surrey and Borders
Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (SABP) on the site of St. Peter's
Hospital. Following her admission she was begun on alcohol
detoxification treatment and was assessed as being at high risk of suicide
and/or self harm whilst intoxicated.

(On 5th October 2018 Miss Smith absconded from the ACU whilst out on.
tunescorted leave and was taken to A&E at St. Peter's Hospital by a
‘member of the public before being returned to the ACU in a highly
intoxicated state.

(On 6 October 2018 she was placed on a short-term section which was
subsequently allowed to lapse on 9 October 2018.

(On 10th October 2018 she again absconded from the ACU following a
period of escorted leave. She was returned to the ACU by a new
acquaintance in the early hours of the 11th October 2018, again in a highly
intoxicated state.

On 12th October 2018 she left the ACU for several short periods of
tunescorted leave and returned as expected, She was then moved from 15
minute to hourly observations. At 15:20 she was signed out on
tunescorted leave and was expected back at 16.30 but she did not return,

At approximately 19:30 and 22:30 on 12 October 2019 an acquaintance of
Mise Smith’s called the ACU to say that she was intoxicated and that he
‘was concerned about her. At 00,05 on 13th October2018, Kimberley Smith
‘was retumed to the car park of the Abraham Cowley Unit by the same
acquaintance. However, she absconded before going back in to the unit

and the acquaintance handed over Miss Smith’s bag to ACU staff which
contained bottles of alcohol, over the counter medication, razor blades
and string,

AL00:10 on 13 October 2018 the ACU staff called the police and reported
Mise Smith as missing and a missing person’s investigation was
commenced.

At approximately 14:00 on 13 October 2018 two female patients of the
ACU saw and spoke to Miss Smith in a wooded area adjacent to the unit
shortly before 14:00 and agreed to return there later that afternoon to see
her. At approximately 16:45 the same patients returned to the wooded
area and found Miss Smith with a plastic bag over her head tied with
string. Emergency services were called to the scene and paramedics
declared Miss Smith deceased at 17:04 on the 13th October 2018.

The jury's narrative conclusion is set out below:
The following made a material contribution to Kimberley Smith's death:

«The care planning and risk management in relation to Kimberley Smith's,
use of alcohol and the risks she posed to herself if she left the ward and
consumed alcohol were inadequate.

‘The failure to assess and detain Kimberley Smith under the Mental
Health Act on either the 8th or 11th October 2018.

‘The decision to allow Kimberley Smith to leave the unit on unescorted
leave from 11th October 2018.

«The nursing staff on duty on the Abraham Cowley Unit on 12th October
2018 did not have sufficient knowledge and understanding of Kimberley
Smith's recent history, alcohol dependency and tisk.

«The failure of nursing staff to carry out an adequate tisk assessment prior
to the decision to allow Kimberley Smith to leave the Abraham Cowley
Unit at 15:20 on 12th October2018.

« The failure of the staff on duty on the Abraham Cowley Unit on the day
shift to activate the missing person protocol on 12th October 2018 before
the end of theie shift.

«The failure of the staff on duty on the Abraham Cowley Unit on the night
shift to activate the missing person protocol on 12th October 2018 following
a telephone call to the ward at approximately 19,30.

The following possibly made a material contribution to Kimberley Smith's
death:

*# The decision to reduce the level of observations on Kimberley Smith from,
every 15 minutes to hourly on 12th October 2018.

+ A failure by the staff on duty on the Abraham Cowley Unit on 13th
October 2018 to make fellow patients aware that Kimberley Smith had not
retumed to the ward since the previous day.

‘The information available and provided to the police by the Abraham
Cowley Unit nursing staff when she was reported missing on 13th October
2018, including the lack of a completed Missing Persons Pack, was
inadequate.

‘# The recording of the information on the Computer Aided Dispatch
(ICAD) that was obtained during a phone call from Surrey Police at 01.00
on 13th October 2018 with a witness, was inadequate.

* The absence of any warning markers on the Police National Computer or
the Surrey Police System NICHE with regards to three recent incidents
Which had resulted in Kimberley Smith being detained by the police under
5.136 of the Mental Health Act.

Kimberley Smith’s death was contributed to by Neglect

CORONER'S CONCERNS
The Coroner's concerns are as follows:

During the inquest the court heard evidence regarding the policies and.
procedures in place governing requests by informal patients to leave the
ACU.

The Coroner heard evidence, and accepts, that this is a complex issue in
that informal patients are entitled to their liberty whilst at the same time
potentially presenting a tisk of harming themselves.

The Coroner is concerned ~ particularly given the complexity of this issue
~ that there is no written policy or guidance on it aside from a short
paragraph within the Trust’s policy governing leave for detained patients.

In particular, there appears to be no clear written policy/procedure on the
following:

= The carrying out of risk assessments when informal patients
request to leave the unit;

= The relevance of an informal patient being on intermittent
observations when they request to leave the unit;

= The processes to follow if informal patients are risk assessed as too
high risk to leave the unit;

+ The risk management plans to put in place when informal patients
do leave the unit;

= The recording of assessments and decisions relation to requests
‘made by informal patients to leave the unit;

= The timeframe for reporting informal patients to the police as
missing persons if they fail to return at the agreed time.

Whilst the inquest into Miss Smith’s death was concerned with the
policies in place for informal patients, the Coroner is not aware of a dear
timeframe for reporting detained patients either and consideration should
be given to introducing a clear timeframe for detained patients as well.

Consideration should also be given to ensuring that all staff are fully
trained and competent in any new policies and/or procedures introduced
in relation to the matters set out above.

During the course of the inquest the court also heard that following Miss
Smith’s death SABP carried out a Serious Incident investigation which
resulted in the following recommendation,

“To develop a protocol for managing alcohol detoxification on mental
health wards, including specific care plans, minimum monitoring and.
how to manage leave requests during treatment.’

The court heard that a protocol has been developed to manage the
‘medical aspects of alcohol detoxification but does not cover care plans,
‘minimum monitoring or the management of leave request during,
treatment.

It is of concern that these aspects of the recommendation remain
outstanding and consideration should be given to implementing them as
‘a matter of urgency.

The MATTER OF CONCERN is:
1. There is no clear written policy/procedure on the following:

= The carrying out of risk assessments when informal patients
request to leave the unit;

= The relevance of an informal patient being on intermittent
observations when they request to leave the unit;

= The processes to follow if informal patients are risk assessed as too
high risk to themselves to leave the unit;

= The risk management plans to put in place when informal patients
do leave the unit;

= The recording of assessments and decisions relation to requests
‘made by informal patients to leave the unit;

= The timeframe for reporting informal patients to the police as
missing persons if they fail to return at the agreed time.

2. There is no clear written policy/procedure on the following:

= The timeframe for reporting detained patients to the police as
missing persons if they fail to retum at the agreed time.

3. Consideration should be given to introducing written policies in
relation to the above matters and to ensuring that all staff are fully
trained and competent in relation to these matters,

4. Consideration should be given to implementing the
recommendation arising from the Serious Incident investigation to
develop a protocol for managing alcohol detoxification on mental
health wards, including specific care plans, minimum monitoring,
and how to manage leave requests during treatment,

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN
In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I
believe that the people listed in paragraph one above have the power to
take such action.

regulations 28 and 29.

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

On 29 July 2020, 1 commenced an investigation into the death of Agnés
Blandine Marthe Marchessou. The investigation concluded at the end of
the inquest on 25 November 2020. | made a narrative determination,
which | attach,

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

‘Agnés Marchessou hanged herself on 13 or 14 July 2020. She died by
suicide. She had suffered fragile mental health for the four or five years
leading up to her death,

(On 4 July 2020, she was arrested for assault following a domestic
incident. On 8 July 2020, she was knocked over by a bus. Police and
ambulance services attended and she was conveyed to hospital.

CORONER'S CONCERNS.

During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving
rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur
unless action is taken. In the circumstances, itis my statutory duty to
report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows,

Metropolitan Police Service officers attended Ms Marchessou on 8 July
2020, after she had been knocked over by the bus.

1

One of the police officers interviewed the bus driver, who told him
that Ms Marchessou had stopped when the bus driver sounded
his hom, but then had stepped straight in front of the bus, and.
after she had been hit had got up and run in front of another bus,
only being saved when a passer-by grabbed hold of her.

The police officer did not pass on this crucial account to the
‘emergency ambulance crew who transported Ms Marchessou to
hospital, nor to any of the doctors or nurses at the hospital

Ms Marchessou told the police officers that she had blacked out
and could not remember what had happened, then that she
thought she had stepped into the road as the result of a panic
attack. She also said that she had stepped in front of the bus
because she was upset about being denied contact with her
children,

‘The police officers did not pass on the crucial information that Ms.
Marchessou said she had stepped in front of the bus because she
was upset about being denied contact with her children, either to
the emergency ambulance crew or to the treating doctors or

‘The two police officers waited with Ms Marchessou at the hospital
for well over two hours, but did not at any point during that time
radio police control to ask for any enquiries or searches of police
systems to be made.

‘Such information could have been potentially extremely helpful to
those treating Ms Marchessou.

When the police officers returned to the police station, they did
make a search themselves and discovered that she had been
arrested for domestic violence. However, they did not make a
Merlin record of her potential vulnerability and need for
assistance.

5. Iwas provided with a statement from one of the two police officers
jn advance of the inquest and | called him to give oral evidence
(on 25 November 2020. When | put to him the sub optimal nature
of the way that he had dealt with the incident on 8 July 2020, he
did not appear to have undertaken any reflection on this in the
intervening four and a half months, nor in the witness box.

If there was any error in not passing on information, he attributed
this error to his colleague. He did not consider that he had failed
to apply a healthy degree of scepticism to Ms Marchessou’'s
version of events, particularly in the light of the bus driver's,
description. He reiterated the view he had formed on the day, that
‘Agnés Marchessou being hit by a bus was purely an accident.

‘The police officer defended all of his actions robustly. | could not
see that he had leamt anything as a result of these events or that
anything about his practice would change in the future.

6. The police officer giving evidence was aware of the view of the
Directorate of Professional Standards (OPS) regarding the failure
to create a Merlin, expressed in its report on the police handiing
of the incident on 8 July, but he seemed very confused about how
that should workin practice.

I he is confused, even after police have taken him through the
DPS report, then other police officers may also be confused.

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and |
believe that you have the power to take such action,

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(On 11/12/18 an investigation was commenced into the death of Xuanze Piao. The
investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 06/11/20. The determination
fof the inquest as to the medical cause of death was a massive head injury and
multiple trauma owing to impact with a train, and as to conclusion, suicide

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

In Autumn 2018, Xuanze was a student attending Coventry University enrolled on
2 degree course in Architecture. He was aged 17, having been born on 10/12/2000
Jn the Heping district of Shenyang, China. He was living in student accommodation,

[At Coventry University he was categorised as a Tier 4 overseas student. Due to his
‘age and nationality he was required to have a guardian within the UK. A condition
fof his UK student visa was that he attended his university course. Xuanze’s
attendance on his university course was limited. Because of the amount of the
course he missed he was sent a number of emails requesting his attendance at
‘meetings with staf to discuss his absence. He did not respond to these invitations
which resulted in an email being sent to him on 29/11/2018, indicating that he
was at risk of being removed from the course and that he should attend a meeting
to discuss this on 03/12/2038; removal from the course would in turn have
affected his permission to remain in the UK on his student visa. There was no face
to face meeting with Xuanze in advance of the email being sent to him on
29/11/2018, and neither Xuanze’s family nor his guardian were informed that
Xuanze was not attending his university course, nor were they informed of the
‘meeting he had been requested to attend to discuss his removal from the course.

(0n 03/12/18 shortly before S a.m. Xuanze left his student accommodation and
went to Coventry Railway station. He walked to the end of platform one and
proceeded along the side of the tracks. Approximately 500 meters outside of
Coventry Railway station heading south, Xuanze was struck by a passenger train
which caused him to sustain catastrophic injuries. He is likely to have died instantly
as. result ofthe collision and his life was formally declared extinct at 07:35 hours.
The inquest conclusion is suicide.

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS
During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to
concern. In my opinion there isa risk that future deaths could occur unless action
Js taken. In the circumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

(.2) The University did not have a face to face meeting with Xuanze, a student
under the age of 18, prior to sending him the email dated 29/11/2018 indicating
that he was at risk of being removed from the course and that he should attend a
‘meeting to discuss this on 03/12/2018;

(2) In the absence of aface to face meeting with Xuanze, the University did not
contact either Xuanze’s Guardian or Parents prior to sending Xuanze the email
dated 29/11/2018 indicating that Xuanze was at risk of being removed from the
course and that he should attend a meeting to discuss this on 03/12/2018;

Evidence was given at the inquest that in the case of an overseas student under
418, notwithstanding both prolonged absence from academic commitments and a
persistent omission to respond to email requests that the absentee student should
‘make contact with the university, there was no procedure or policy in place either
for aface to face meeting with the student or, in the absence of such a face to face
‘meeting, for contacting that student's Guardian or Parents, prior to the email
being sent indicating that the U.L8 student was at risk of being removed from the
course and that he should attend a meeting to discuss ths.

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your
‘organisation has the power to take such action.

own life on 25 February 2020 and as such | gave a conclusion of suicide
The medical cause of death after post mortem was

Date: 27 October 2020

Case: 333890
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Mr Martin Thomas Barrett took part in a telephone consultation
assessment with the Priory Group by a Cognitive Behavioural Therapist
for anxiety at 8am on the morning of his death. During that assessment,
he stated that he had thought about suicide and planned how this may
‘occur but did not indicate any immediate intent. The Therapist informed
the Court that she considered that he was high risk of suicide but that he
had engaged with her safety planning and had agreed to take steps to
keep himself safe. The Therapist therefore made an internal referral for
a same day appointment with a Consultant Psychiatrist at the Priory
Group for further assessment. This referral was made after the
appointment and considered by the Consultant after his morning clinic
‘which was around lunchtime. The Psychiatrist declined the referral as
he considered that the needs of Mr Barrett were too complex and would
be better resolved within the NHS. This decision was not communicated
to Mr Barrett. Sadly he was found hanging at his home address around,
3pm that day.

CORONER'S CONCERNS,

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving
rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur
Unless action is taken. In the circumstances itis my statutory duty to
report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

During oral evidence, | was advised that when an onwards internal
referral is made to another clinician within the Priory Group which is
then declined this is not communicated directly to the patient if the
treatment is funded by way of insurance cover. In those cases a
notification would be provided to the insurers or the policyholder and
then the Priory Group would not have any further contact with the
patient. As such, patients that are considered to be higher risk by the
Glinician at initial assessment may not therefore have the opportunity to
imminently consider alternative sources of treatment or receive any
advice as to safely netting in the interim as this information is not being
provided by clinicians to the patient. From the evidence that | heard it
‘would be reliant on their insurers or corporate policy holders (who may
‘well not be clinicians) to make contact with the patients to inform them
of this during which time their health may have further declined or their
risk increased.

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN
In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and | believe the Priory
Group has the power to take such action.

YOUR RESPONSE

You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this repor,
namely by 26 December 2020. |, the coroner, may extend the period

In evidence twas heard that Piotr had not received his ‘depot’ medication for some
time and was clearly suffering from a psychotic episode al the time of his assessment
athe Accident and Emergency department of the West Suffolk Hospital on the 16""
December 2019

Pot tld staff he was no actively suicidal at that pont in time, and although the staff
‘wore concerned about his presentation, under mental heath law last restive
Principles, they did not believe the powers of detention under the Mental Heath Act
‘were applicable,

‘That said, was also lea from the evidence that the mental health personnel who
‘2 Ptr wanted to immediately admit im as an informal patient

ttwas also clear that when Pot attended hospital onthe 16* December 2019, he loo
wanted tobe immediately admited as an informal patent

‘As a result, staf tried to locate a bed for Piolo he could be admitted as al involved
‘wished. However, it was identified that there were no beds available in Suffolk,
‘Snjwre else nthe country att ti,

Diferent options of keeping Piotr inthe hospital were explored but none were viable.

{As such, Pilr was prescribed medication to reduce his immediate anxiety and sent
home with a fiend, with instructions to return i his symploms deteriorated

Pot took his own fe the next moming before he could be retuned to hospital
Had @ bed been avaiable and Piotr had bean admitted as he and medical staff had

ished on the evening ofthe 16"" December 2019, his death would not have

[BROWN aged 23. The investigation concluded at the end ofthe inquest on 12"" August 2020. The
Conclusion ofthe inquest was thatthe death was a suicide. The medical certfied cause of death

1a Hanging

4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

\iktor John Anthony Scot-Brown was found hanging at his home address overnight on the 140/15""
December 2018 and pronounced dead at the scene. There were no suspicious circumstances, He
had recently been prescribed Lamatigine but had not been warned thal use ofthat medication caries
‘ek of causing thoughts of sof harm or suicide, and is taking of that medication was not monitored
‘Sccordingly. Had he Been informed ofthat risk, he would have sought medical assistance when he
began fo experience thoughts of self harm and suicide, and tis unikely he would have taken his fe
vanen he i

‘5 CORONER'S CONCERNS:
‘The MATTERS OF CONCERNS are a flows:

Mr Scott-Brown was prescribed Lamotrigine by an NHS Foundation Trust Consultant Psychiatrist.
‘The prescribing consuitant did not give Mr Scot-Brown a Trust information sheet about Lamotrigine
{and & Patient Information Leaflet abou! Lamotgine from the rug manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKine. It
was common ground thatthe consultant should have done so. Both documents record as a side
fffect of using Lamotrigine a risk that tha pation! may begin to experience thoughls of sal-harm oF
suicide. Mr Scott-Brown was never given that information,

‘The consultant gave evidence that he was not aware ofthat particular side effect of Lamotrigine, and
that his preserbing practoe was informed by the Briish National Formulary and The Mauisio

rescibing Guidelines. Nether the online BNF viewable via the NIGE website nor the 10% Ealion of
‘The Maudsley Guidelines (to sthich the court wae referred) refer otha side effect in their respective
entries for Lamotrigine.

‘Subsequent tothe conclusion ofthe Inquest, | have leamed from the Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust
that when Mr ScottBrown was prescribed Lamotrigine, the ten curent aiton of the Maudsley
Guidelines was the 13 Edition. The Inquest heard no evidence about the 13% Edition of the
Maudsley Guidelines and information therein concerning Lamotrigne.

‘Quite apart from any issue regarding the consultant's knowledge about Lamotrigine (and the
existence of the 13"" Edition ofthe Maudsley Guidelines) and his not having given Mr Scot-Brown
the Trusts prepared information about the drug and is side effects, 1 am concerned that two
cbviously reputable sources of phammacologcal information are apparently silent, or have been
Sent, on a potentially significant side effect ofthis particular drug

From a lay perspective, there is apparent potential for harm to patients depending upon which
resources a prescriber consults before prescribing Lamotrigine. Thal potential for harm might be
‘ameliorated were the advice about Lamotrigine consistent across all such resources

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action shouldbe taken to prevent future deaths and | believe your organisation has the
power to take such action.

In the case of NICE, that power arses from the ENF being a resource accessible on the NICE
website,

In the case of The South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and the Oxleas NHS
Foundation Trust, that power arises from the credied authors and dors of The Maudsley
Prescribing Guidelines (10 Eaton) being in post within those Trusts respectively.

In the case of Informa Healthcare, that power arses from that corporate entity being the publisher of
‘The Maudsley Presering Guidelines.

In the case of the Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust, thal power arses fom the
Trust being ina positon to ensure tha is prescribers work wih reference tothe up to date edition of
‘any resource upon which they rely for prescribing guidance,

3 | INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

‘An inquest was opened into the death of Patricia Ferguson onthe 9” May 2019 and
Concluded on the 15"" August 2019. The conclusion of he inquest was thal the death
was suicide. Prior lo the death Patria Ferguson had been in receipt of secondary
‘mental health services from her local Community Mental Health Team. The care
Bforded by the einisians working wth Parcia Ferguson was good. ‘The psychiatrist
land community psychiatric nurse working with Patricia Ferguson formed the cincal view
that she would Benefit from drat work rom a cinical psychologist. A cnial
psychologist was not, however, avaiable fo carry out direct work.

| CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Patricia Ferguson sufered signifcant mental il heath a times. She was admitted as an
inpatient on one occasion and on other aceasions she received secondary mental
healthcare including medication, regular review trom a Consultant Psychiatrist and
suppor from Community Psychiatric Nurses. When unwell, Patricia Ferguson would
'ypieally be overwhelmed with negative thoughts and emotions on a particular issue.
This led ta her completed suicide. The cnicians working with Patricia Ferguson
considered thatthe particular ype ofintrvantions which can only be undertaken by a
‘nial paycholagist would be of benefit to Patria Ferguson,

‘The inquest heard evidence fom Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust regarding slat
eslabishment within CMTS. A cinical psychologist was employed by the CMHT
working with Patria Ferguson but was unable to take an new patient as there was
{g9ing o be a planned period of extended absence.

‘The inquest heard evidence that clinical psychology was a ‘precious resource within the
CCMHTS. In tems of clinical psychology posts, the inquest head that in some CMTS
within Nottinghamshire there i afll me equivalent post and in other teams tis may be
8 shared post, or a less than fulltime equivalent past. No eam have more than one
clinical psychologist.

tomake the best use of their clinical psychologists by means ofa new infernal protocol

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving ise to concern. In
my opision there isa risk that future deaths wil occur unless action is taken. Inthe
‘roumstances iis my statutory duly to report to you

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

(1) The Joint Commissioning Panel for Mental Health's Guidance for Commissioners of
Community Specialist Mental Heath Services expresses an expectation that there would
bbe more than one clinical psychologist for each Community Mental Health Team, given
thal cinical psychologists are refered o inthe plural within discussions of an
‘appropriate staf tam for CMHTs whereas, for example, consultant psychiatrists are
Feferred tain the singular.

(2) CMTS in Nottingham and Notinghamshre have a commissioned establishment of
‘at most, one clinical psychologist per team, with some teams having only a pat time
Clinical psychologist post. Ths ineviably results in some patens, as here, having no
‘access fo clinical psychology when thie clinically indicated, creating an ongoing ik of
preventable future deaths

‘ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

For thefye months preceding her death Ms Sutton was nan abusive relationship, Following her death
‘onthe 26"" august 2017, a police Investigation and trial at St Alba's Crown Court resulted inthe
‘corwlton of Ms Suton partner for controling or coercive behaviour In an intimate relationship and
two counts of assault. He received a custodal sentence of 4 years 3 month imprisonment and a minal
‘behaviour order was imposed.

In ation to the part played by her relationship, the Inquest examined two ses that elated to
Hertfordshire Constabulary. The second aso relates to the Police Service more widely

‘The fist sue concerned the attendance of pole officers at Ms Suttons home onthe ul 2017,
responding toa elsturbance reported by a nelghbour and the adequacy of ther ations a the time.

‘The second issue, which was highlighted inthe Domestic Homicde Review OHA], related to the
_valabity of nor-rime information tothe pole. In this ase, there was no match with records In
‘respect of domestic abuse by Ms Suttons partner against other victims, despite there being reports to
the police from 3 previous partners.

""These reports, belng now cme reports, were not avalabe to ofcers ures they searched forthe

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

‘On 26% October 2017 I commenced an investigation into the death of LAN JAMES
WEEKS. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11"" March 2020.
“The medical cause of death provided was: Ia) Pressure on the neck consistent wih
hanging; 2. Synthetic cannabinoid use, The Coroner's conclusion a the end ofthe
Inquest was: A case of suicide

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH
‘These were recorded as:-

Tan Weeks was remanded into custody at HMP Cardiff on the 7th August 2017.
He was assessed by prison and healthcare staff as not being at risk of self-
harming o suicide

Sometime between 20.20 on the 20th of October and the 21st of October whilst
alone in his cell, Cell 13, 2nd floor, F-wing believing that personal relationships
had recently broken down he made a ligature from the bed sheet and hung
himself from the shower rail in his cell

CORONER'S CONCERNS,

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concer,
mn there isa risk tha future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the
it s my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF
CONCERN are as follows. ~ (1) Although it was recorded on System I that Me
‘Weeks had recently attempted suicide in another prison shortly before his admission
10 HMP Cardiff no member of Healthcare staff checked the medical records and
further that although the GP records which were sent tothe prison confirmed that Mr
‘Weeks was prescribed anti-depressants in the community no member of Healtheare

staff noticed this and as a consequence Mr Weeks was not given anti-depressants in
HMP Cacditf

‘The Healthcare witnesses, including the Head of Healtheare, indicated that a red flag for
suicide of self-harm would be of great value for staff who because of insufficient staff and a
heavy workload did not have time to review the System I record in any or any sulficient
detail

Further it was considered that all System 1 records should be reviewed when an individual
‘admitted into the prison and that there should be in place a process for doing so.

6, ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

ln my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and [believe you and
Yyour organisation have the power to take such action.

7. YOUR RESPONSE

3 | INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

;Betwoon 19"" November 2019 and 28 November 2018, evidence was heard touching
the death of Rebecca Jane Hursey. Rebecca had died at St George's Hospital on 4
May 2018, folowing an aspirin overdose taken whilst detained under Section 3 of the
‘Mental Health Act a Sprngfels Hospital. She was 39 years old atthe ime of her death
‘The Jury made the following findings:

Medical Cause of Death

1 (a) Malti-organ failure
(b) Salicylate poisoning -

II Mixed personality disorder, Eating disorder non-specified, Significant self-
arm

How, when, where and in what circumstances Rebecca came by her death:
Rebecca Hursey ded on 4/572018 at 00:54 at CITU St George's Hospital of mult-organ

faire and saloyiate poisoning, caused by a sof administered overdose of aspirin,
which was discovered at approx. 5:18 am on 35/20%8,

‘Atthe te of her death she was diagnosed with mbxed and other personality disorders,
‘eating isorder non specied, chronic microcyse anaemia and significant sel-harm,

‘She was receiving care on the Avalon Ward which is an eating disorder unt at
‘Springfield Hospital, and she was subject to Sec 3 of the Mental Heath Act. She was
suffering with severe and enduring mental lines. The overdose occurred while
Rebecca was under level 3 observation. Overnight observations between 2/5/2018 and
3182018 were not recorded in ine withthe Observation and Engagement policy
‘Observations and searches were unable to mitgate her risk of self-harm and suicide,
Exionsve and so far, unsuccessful searches had been undertaken for altemative
placements fo provide her wth required treatment and to more safely manage her risk of
Settharm

‘An “impasse” in treatment for har dlagnoss had arisen but dayto-day toatment
‘continued,

Rebecca's tness was euch tha her state of mind was very delicately balanced: she
was easily and deeply distressed by clinical treatments and by proposed changes to her
‘suppor arrangements,

Proceeding her death these mattrs impacted her state of min:
‘Treatment wih on infusion under restraint

Impending loss of her psychotherapist.

Postponement as she perceived It ofthe meeting to plan her future on 304/2018,
Posse negative impact of multiple psychiatric assessments,

Feeling 2n imbo"" in elaton to discharge.

With regards to matiors that possibly contributed to her death
Handover system in place onthe 2/5/2078 should have allowed the allocated nurse to
familarse themselves wth wettan records by the psychotherapist

Ifthe suicidality captured inthe writen records of the psychotherapist had been noted,
further epinion would have been sought and extra viganice would have putin place.
‘The prolonged ang unsuccessful search for an alternative placement that started in
February 2014 uni the timo of her death impacted the stale of Rebecca's mind and
cfectiveness of her teaiment

‘Wit regards to matters which may probably have caused or contributed to her death
Her inal t accept the diagnosis and accept treatment appropriately,

Her underlying medical rally with anaemia and heart failure.

Hee overal high risk of suicidality and seltnarm,

In the time leading up to her death, Avalon was an inappropriate placement for Rebecca
to provise treatment consistent with her dagnoss. Avalon was an inappropriate place to
‘manage her high sk of suicidality and se-harm

Conclusion ofthe Jury as to the death:

Rebecca Jane Hursey took her own life whilst suffering with severe and enduring,
mental illness.

‘Extensive evidence was taken court ln summary, of relevance to Wis report

‘On the day that Rebecca is thought to have taken the overdose that tok her life she
hhad been recognised by the psychologist as stongly and actively suicidal. This was
recorded in the notes, but not passed on verbaly by him tothe nurse in charge,

Handover was verbal between shifts and this increased suicidal sk was not appreciated
by the allocated nurse such that extra support for Rebecca was not considered atthe
materia time.

‘Rebecca had been a patent on Avalon from June 2013. Discharge was considered from
‘early 2014 but no sultableallemative placement was found for her prior to her death in
May 2018. Her complexity and suicidality was well documented from eary on in her
psychiatric cae, as far back as 2002 when she was ving in Leicester, but withthe lack
‘of somewhere suitable to go, Avalon was leftn an untenable postion of having no
‘choice but to provide in-patient care for Rebecca, when it was clearly recognised that
‘the waré could not manage her sucialiy, nor provide suitable treatment for her.

‘She had been referred to Avalon from Leicester based services, but they found no
placement intel area, where she sil had a residential address, for her to return to

‘Concerns of the Coroner:

1. That taf handovers be led by examination ofthe cinical record such that
recent progress can be assessed especially in relation to risk management
‘and care plans amended accordingy.

2, That practitoners who recognise inctease in suicidal sk of a patient should
‘pass ths on verbally to the nurse on charge of the ward or the nurse
‘located tothe patient.

3. That NHS England considera system of introducing deadtines for
‘aferatve placements tobe found for such patients, so that they must be
found in a timely fashion.

4. That placements for patients with high risk of selt-narm, such as Rebecca
_2r0 prioritised such that safer placements are found within a timely fashion.

'5. Thal bespoke placements are considered eary inthe discharge process for
complex paints

6. That consideration be given tothe “sharing” of such complex and high-risk
patients between units early on the in-patient stay to help provide the patient
‘wah more sutable care and share te stress of caring for such unwell
patients on staff and other patents. One way this could be done would be to
Consider a network arrangement between different units fo avold the risk of
‘Sinica sos between the diferent sections ofthe mental health services.
‘and encourage a more wholistc approach to service provision

procestes had not had ACCT training for over three years ~ and surprisingly twas another three
Years belore he underwent SASH traning. As HMP Liverpool were present throughout this
Ifvestigaion, the court understands that these raining issues are being resolved localy. However
this i a national sue and Iti important that nol only should HMPPS hold training records for
those employed inthe prison service but that each individual should have a personal raining
record would help if traning crtfcates with expiry dates were issued afer al courses with 2
copy baing given to attendees and the record being held by the prison service. This would ensure
alloficers with curent raining could work across the prison estate, adding resiionce

CORONER'S CONCERNS

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERNS are 2 flows:

A

‘The computer system used by CNWL is known as SystmOne. Heathcae staff working on
Reception when Mr Goldsraw fst aived at tho prison had access fo his previous medical
Noles and history (around 240 pages in al) stored on SyatmOne. The records conained
‘humerous references to suicidal ideation and previous atempts at deliberate veisham. Me
CGoldtraw had atlempted to tate his own ife on several previous occasions, the most recent
‘of which was only three months prior to his artval st the prison Howover. despite a
Brotferaton of enes making reference to his mental heath history the mental health nares
Who has access to SystmOne was seemingly unaware of the relevant entries. Had be been,
he sid he would Rave opened an ACCT

‘SystmOne makes 1 difeuit for doctor or mental health nurse to ascertain the key
Information needed to undertake a rik assessment and to decge whether or not to open sn

lansweres a seros of preset questions.

‘The *Actve Problems"" section of SystmOne is subdivided ino @ number of ditnct areas and
It appears to be whaly Inadequate i tors of kentiying key areas of concerm such as the

by a RAID (Rapid Assessment intervention & Discharge) team. Samantha was
‘assessed as not needing admission. Samantha wae prescribed olanzapine and was to

‘The MATTER OF CONCERN is that despite the concems ofthe RAID practitioner that
the HBTT refused to accept Samantha, as she didnot i the protocal for acceptance, on
the fist two requests. The HBTT was the only means by which Samantha could be
‘monitored other than an admission and satisfy the RAID pracitoners concerns,
‘Samantha was accepted by the HTT on the thd time of asking. This appears tobe
‘because the person receiving the request was prepared fo see Samana, a person
rather than be restricted by protocol and by the fat that the RAID practioner was 0
‘concerned about Samantha that she was going io review Samantha within the RAID
processes, which was not part fits remit. Without monitoring would not have been
possible to prescribe olanzapine.

‘There is clearly lacuna inthe provision of supervision and monterng of patients who
‘are not deemed admissibie, voluniarly or by section between the RAID and HTT
services. The RAID pracitioner should not have experienced such dficlty in obtaining
‘monitoring for Samantha, @ patent who appeared to fall between the protocols of two

running in atic on a main rad.

3. We heard evidence that Lauren experienced thoughts of suicide and self-harm
al of the time. However, there were periods when these thoughts would

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion
thre sa rik that fulure deaths wil cur uniess action is taken. Inthe crcumstances i

Ts my Statutory duty to repor To you,

During the inquest, evidence was heard tha:

1. Nursing staf and Health Care Assistants on Westleigh Ward at Atherleigh Park
Hospital were carrying out (and continue to carry out) observations of patients at
precise intervals (for example, ia patient is on hal-hourly observations, stat
‘explained that they would aim to cary out observations at 10.00 am, 10.30 a.m.
iam etc). Further, all cords showed thatthe timings of observations were
at precise intervals.” This is not in accordance with the Trusts polcy of
‘servations which confirms that observations shouldbe iesguar but win the
(9. 30 minute) window. The reason for this policy is cleary to avoid a situation
whereby a patient can predict when they wil nxt be observed (and offer an
‘opportunity for the patient to take action to harm herset during that period of
time).

2, The Deputy Ward Manager on Westiigh Ward at Athereigh Park Hospital
confirmed that she did not and stil does not check that observations by staff are
being cari out in accordance with the Trust policy despite accepting that ths
was her role when the nurse in charge ofa shit. Further, the Deputy Manager
ot Weelleigh Ward did not understand tha Polcy and thought that observations
were fo be carried out at regular intervals (as relerred to above)

3. The Trust carried aut an investigation following the death of Lauren. twas of
concern that the lead Investigator (who gave evidence at the Inquest) dd not
lunderstand the Observation Policy and suggested that observations should be
Caried out al regular intervals (which was corect) but then gave an example of
10 minute observations being carried outa: 10 am, 10.08 am, 10.20 am (which
Is clearly notin accordance wih the Poly). ‘The interval should never exceed
the 10 minute period (and there is 12 minutes between 10.08 am and 10.20,
am).

4, There were examples in the records of nursing staff puting in enties 24 hours
ater the event had occurred. Whit tis accepted that nursing staff may, an
‘eeasion, need to wat some time belore marking an entry into the ‘cinical
record, a period of 24 hours when dealing with patients a risk of sel-harm and
Suicide means that relevant information is potentially not avalable to staff onthe
next shit

‘ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action shouldbe taken to provent future deaths and I believe you have the
ower o take such action.

‘CORON EF

During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving ise to concem. In
imy opinion there i a rick that fture deaths wil occur unless acton i taken. In the
‘cumstances tis my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

During the Inquest:

‘The University accepted during the course of the inquest that, due to the non=
‘mandatory nature of tutorials and homework, within the Schoo! of Mathematics,
i was difficult to assess whether a student was strugging unil examination
failures unless they epecifcaly brought issues to the attention of the university
thamselves,

During the frst year of the mathematics degre, students were not required to
fationd lectures” or woekly tutorials, and weekly homework set was_not
‘mandatory. AS a result of this there were no sanctions, or requirements to meat
‘nth form tutors or other tutors within tre School of Mathematics at any point
within the year,

‘There is no requirement to mest wih a tutor a the school of mathematics after
{allure of an examination;

During the second year there was signicant less opportunity to have contact
withthe students. This was due to tho fact that there were no weekY tutorials
with personal tutors, There were lectures each week, for all School of
Mathematics students however, allendance was not monitored and was not
mandatory. Therefore, sometimes you only notice after exams if a student Is
really stugging,

“The university accepted that after this they then reach a dead end, where they
believe a student's unwel but they have no other means of addressing I.
Students can be required to withdraw ffom the universty with no face to face
Contact with any member ofthe University stat

‘The University detalles how they had changed their policies to adress issues
highighted, but accepted that without. adequate monitoring measures,
‘mandatory attendance to tutorial and mandatory Homework assignments, and In
the absence of sanctions for non-atlendance of tutorials or fling to hand in
homework assignments, the policies may nat bit. It was accepted that, were
the same sition to present iself again with another student, k may be tha

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(On 21 September 2018, Senior Coroner Mary Hassell commenced an
investigation into the death of Arun Viswambaran aged 27 years. The
investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 9 January 2019.

‘The conclusion ofthe inquest was that Mr Viswambaran committed suicide.

‘The medical cause of death was:
4a dihydrocodeine and paracetamol toxicity

My short form conclusion was that ""Mr Viswambaran took his own life at his
home on 18 September 2018”

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

‘Me Viswambaran had recently started living with his partner in Tower Hamlets
but remained registered with his family GP at the Redbridge Surgery, 49,
Windermere Gardens, ford, IG4 $82. On 16 July 2017, he saw his GP and
reported that he was depressed. His PHOS score of 19/27 suggested that he had
moderately severe depression. He denied thoughts of suicide or self-harm.
Following a discussion, he was prescribed Sertraline SOmg, given the crisis eam
‘contact number and details of how to refer himself to the IAPT service. He was
reviewed on 3 August 2018 when he reported that he had not noticed much
Improvement in his mood and that he had tried to contact IAPT but had not had
any response. It was decided that he would remain on Sertraline SOmg and
‘would have a further review in 3 weeks’ time. His family and friends noted that
hhe was engaging less with other people, his mood was lower and that he was
being increasingly critical of himself. Arun had a triage telephone call with the
IAPT service and was placed on the waiting list. He did not attend any further
GP appointments and would have run out of Sertraline in early September. On
18 September 2018, Mr Viswambaran told his partner that he was working a
night shift and would be spending the day at home. He resigned from his job by
‘email ater that morning. In the early afternoon, he sent a number of text
‘messages which concerned his friends, When they were unable to make contact,
with him, they asked police to break into the property. Mr Viswambaran was
found dead in the bath. A subsequent post-mortem examination found that he
had overdosed on co-dydramol tablets.

December 2019.

3. The jury determined that the medical cause of death was 12
Hanging.

4. The jury returned a combined conclusion of Suicide and a
Narrative Conclusion in the following terms: ‘namely that the lack
of an adequate third ACCT Case Review was considered to have |
possibly contributed to Daniel Akam's death.” |

4 | CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH ]

|

1. Daniel Akam had some history of depression and self-harm when

in the community. Whitin prison, he had a history oflow mood |
and anxiety.

2. From 4” October 2018, Daniel Akam expressed that he was
receiving threats from other inmates, and was suffering acute
anxiety as a result. An ACCT was opened, and he was
subsequently moved to a different wing on 8"" October 2018.

3 Throo days prior to his death on 10 October 2018, he made
superficial cus to his wrists and forehead, at which point he was
put onto twice hourly ACCT observations. This frequency was to
Continue until further amendment, save 2 further stipulation was
‘added following a third and final ACCT review the day before his
death, on 12"" October 2018, that no observation should be more
than 35 minutes after the preceding observation.

4. Howover, this third ACCT review only lasted for botwoen 5-7
‘minutes, no member of health care was present, and the
assessment wrongly concluded that Daniel Akam posed a risk of
harm to others rather than to himsetf. This was contrary to all his
prison records, with which staff conducting the review had not
sufficiently familiarised themselves. Furthermore, his worsened
mental state was not sufficiently conveyed to health care post
review [The jury concluded thatthe inadequacy ofthis third and
{inal ACCT review possibly contributed to death.

5, Daniol Akam was last seen alive on an ACCT observation at
approximately 8:45am on 13% October 2018.

6. The next ACCT observation due at approximatoly 9:1519:20a.m.
‘was not performed (Although it was left as possibly contributory,
the jury did not find that this factor possibly contributed to death.

7. Daniel Akam was found unresponsive on the floor of his prison cell
with a rope ligature around his neck at 8:4Sa.m; and declared
doceased at 10:30a.m.

8. He was no longer attached to the ligature upon his discovery, and
it was not possible, then or subsequently, to identify the ligature
point in the call; nor how he was able to have a rope in his cell at a
time when he was vulnorable to self-harm.

CORONER'S CONCERNS: |
During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise
to concern. In my opinion there isa risk that future deaths will occur
unless action is taken. In the circumstances itis my statutory duty to

report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. ~

allure to cary out ACCT observations recorded in the ACCT log

(1) CCTV evidence in the inquest established that 18 observations on
‘Mr Akam were not carried out

(2) The same 18 missed observations were recorded in the ACCT
document as having been carried out, when they had not been.

(3) Five different prison officers purportedly signed various of these
entries.

(4) Whilst the above missed observations occurred 24 hours priorto
Daniel Akam's death and were not contributory, the purpose of |
ACCT observations is to reduce the risk of suicide and self-
harm in 2 vulnerable prisoner. If necessary observations are
missed, the risk of suicide and self-harm amongst vulnerable
prisoners will kely increase.

|

| (6) The fact that the five separate officers did not carry out
‘observations, when they recorded that they did, indicates that
the problem is systemic.

|
| ACCT training for prison officers

(6) In addition, the evidence revealed that the prison officers did not
‘appear to know what their own obligations and responsibilities
were in relation to the ACCT procedure and processes. The
general evidential picture was that of inadequate ACCT training
for officers, who universally indicated that it would be helpful to
have refresher training,

(7) Unless adequate and repeated ACCT training is provided for all
officers, particulary for those junior and more inexperienced
officers, the lives of vulnerable prisoners will not be

| ‘safeguarded in accordance with the purpose of the ACCT
i procedure.

| make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and
Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners
(Investigations) Regulations 2013,

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

On 17 July 2017 | commenced an investigation into the death of Jacob
Andrew Bates (dob: 5 January 2000; dod: 15 July 2017). The
investigation concluded by way of an inquest hearing from 2 to 5
December 2019 (a copy of the record of inquest is enclosed with the
‘covering letter to this report). My findings at inquest were as follows: ~

= Medical cause of death: -
‘1a Ligature around the neck.
‘1b Mental health issues and autism,

- Summary of circumstances: -

Jacob died as a result of placing plastic ties around his neck as
ligatures. Although he had not given any immediate indication to
anyone that he was contemplating taking his own life he was
assessed as being at on-going risk of serious self-harm. Due to the
nature of the act, his self-harm history, the on-going assessed risk,
and his leaving of a ‘suicide’ note | found that he had undertaken a
deliberate act with the intention of taking his own life. Just prior to
his death a six month unregulated placement had recently been
ended, and prior to that placement he had spent over two and a
half years in a succession of secure placements.

=]

‘On the evidence | did not find that factors associated with the
unregulated placement had directly contributed to Jacob's death.

My conclusion as to Jacob's death was a short form conclusion of
suicide.

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Jacob had diagnoses of autism and mental health problems. Following a
setious overdose in February 2014 he was thereafter placed in a
‘succession of secure placements under the provisions of the Mental
Health Act 1983 and the Children Act 1989 until he retumed to his home
area of Chesterfield around Christmas 2016 when he was placed, under
the provisions of s.20 Children Act 1989, in an unregulated placement for
young people aged between 16 and 18 years of age and was also
supported by local authority social care’and child and adolescent mental
health services. The Chesterfield placement was not a specialist
placement for young people with autism or mental health problems and
the placement had been made in the context of a specialist placement
having given very short notice of termination of placement. There had
been many episodes of self-harm following the overdose in February,
‘some serious, including just two months prior to his death and he was
assessed at’ on-going isk of serious seltharm. The Chesterfield
placement came to an end following Jacob's decision to move in to lve
with his father where he received on-going suppor from the agencies.

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise
to concem. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur
unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to
report to you.

As | have stated | did not find that the evidence established a causal or
contributory connection between the unregulated placement and Jacob's
death, | found this to be so on the applicable civil law test, the balance of
probabilities. However in my summing-up | did express my serious
‘concems that Jacob had been placed in an unregulated placement
despite his history, needs, and risks.

Evidence was given at the inquest hearing by two former employees at
the placement that they had no prior experience of working with young
people (indeed no experience of working in any form of care-related
work) and were left in charge of the unit where Jacob was placed after a
very short period of commencing employment (one former staff member
said that he had only completed two shadowing sessions before being
asked to be in sole charge of the unit overnight).

‘The evidence of the responsible local authority was that it had not sought
evidence from the placement provider as to staff competency and
training, or that sultable policies and procedures were in place; it
effectively accepted the assurances of the provider,

“The local authority stated that it now has systems providing for greater
scrutiny and diligence - but it’ was explained that where
residentialsupported provision is solely for young people aged 16 to 18
that provision falls outside or the statutory regime of inspection. and
regulatory compliance as enforced by Ofsted. My understanding is that
the issue of unregulated placements for 16 to 18 year olds has been
widely highlighted as a cause for concem but the evidence of a senior
local authority manager at inquest was that she was unaware of any
plans nationally to address the issue despite concems having been very
widely raised.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: -

1

Vulnerable young people, aged 16 to 18, are being placed in
unregulated placements.

‘Any young person under the age of 18 placed in an unregulated
placement is likely to have very significant vulnerabilities, and itis
likely that young people with complex needs and at significant risk
are being placed in such placements; indeed this was the case for
Jacob.

‘As the placements are unregulated there are no statutory
regulations to comply with relating to competency and appropriate |
policies and procedures by the provider and there is no regulatory |
body to check and assess those providers. This is clearly a very
concerning situation given the very high level needs that some of
the young people will have.

The lack of statutory regulation then places an onus on local
authorities to check that a provider is competent and safe. Whilst
in making individual placements it must be the duty of a local
authority to satisfy itself as best as it is able that placements are
‘safe’, glven the pressures on local authorities it cannot be the
case ‘that they are in a position to mirror the type and nature of
inspection and oversight that might be provided by @ regulator
such as Ofsted.

In view of the points made above the lack of statutory regulation is
placing vulnerable young people at risk, and there is a realistic
possibilty that deaths may occur.

‘ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and |
believe you have the power to take such action.

‘YOUR RESPONSE

You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date

3 INQUEST

| concluded the inquest nto the death of Kieran Luke Hubbard on the 12"" December 2019
‘and the jury recorded that ched from

ta Hangng

| came to the Conclusion : Suicide

7 | CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

‘The deceased was born on the 16 August 1998 and was found dead on the 8 February
2019 hanging from a ligature made from a metal cable attached tothe structure ofa building
Inthe process of construction at Vuclan Mil Phase 2, Off Malta Street , Ancoats Manchester
‘APost Mortem examination confrmed the pathological cause of death to be 1a Hanging
Toucological analysis established the presence of citalopram, venlafaxine and diazepam. All
fof these were in therapeutic amounts There was a very small amount of alcohol found that
thus could be due to post-mortem microbial fermentation

Following the death a serious incdent investgation was camed out chaired by a mental
health nurse but not a consultant psychiatrist and no was a psychiatrist recorded as being a
member of the review team or from whom advice was sought. Statements were taken from a
rhumber of healthcare professionals who had been involved in his care and management and
In particular from the consultant psychaatrist who saw him and made mportant/cucial
assessments and decisions about his care and management As a chid he was diagnosed

‘wih ADHD and as a Teenager began taking a number of lic drugs Hie father ran a
Construction business and was able to provide employment for hm The deceased had no
fear of heights and was able to work as what is called a ""Singer

(Over a penod of some years to suffer depressive disorder was preoccupied or obsessed
With suede At tes he could become arnaous or distressed and would often phone his
father for support and as able to calm him down,

(On a family holy in 2017 he appeared to have a mental health crisis and disclosed his
father as he contemplated jumping off buildings he was working on Upon returning from this
holiday he agrees to seek counselling but was reluctant to engage with other mental health
land GP services concerning his overall mental health problems. However, he did accept @
prescription of antidepressant medication

In November 2018 he and his partner had a son after therr relationship began in 2017
However, shortly after the bith ths relationship came to an end and he was extremely
distressed, His partner had another chi from a previous partner and he was concemed
‘about not being able to have contact with both children He experienced dificulies in
‘agreeing arrangements with his former partner to see his son and things came to a head on
26 January 2019 when his former partner cancelled a prearranged contact atthe last minute
He was very distressed by ths later the same day was found on a bridge above the
motorway n West Yorkshire contemplating suicide by jumping off He was detained under
'S 136 ofthe Mental Health Act and taken to a place of safety

‘Atthis time he was stilin employment and had an address n Salford, Manchester but
registered with a GP in a different local area a short distance away There are two pamary
‘mental health NHS Trusts m Greater Manchester One is called Greater Manchester Mental
Health NHS Trust (GMMH). The others Pennine Care foundation Mental Health NHS Trust
(Pcen)

Information was passed to GMM from local mental health services in Yorkshire and he was
‘seen forthe first ume 28 January 2018 for an intal assessment n one of the Trusts
psychiatnc unts having attended ther voluntarily Thereafter he had intermittent contact with
healthcare professionals although agreed that he needed help An experienced consultant
ppaychiatnst working for GMMH first became aware of hum as being a patient on 4 February
2019 at an MDT meeting She raised concems about him driving a motor vehicte wen
‘suffering from an acute mental health cnsis but understood that there was no clear
‘operational policy dealing wih ths witun the trust This psychiainst frst met the deceased
‘and 6 February 2019 when she undertook a detailed interview and psychiatric assessment
‘She concluded that you suffered severe depressive episode which have been progressively
‘geting worse since December 2018 and marked by recurrent sucidal thoughts,

Atthe time ofthis intermew he denied any current active thoughts of suicide but disclosed
that he felt helpless at therr frequency and intensty She advised hum not to drive at this te
‘was not sultabe for home treatment but that he should be admitted to hospital for ongoing
assessment and treatment and he indicated that he was wiling to cooperate and do this His
‘medication was changed but the psychiatrist concluded that he required aggressive
treatment of his depression in a protected and supervised environment Intal enquiries
indicated that there was no bed availabe locally within the GMMH faciities Since he was
registered with a GP in what is described as “outside area"" which although being a very
short distance away was within the catchment area of PCFT. The psychiatnst understood
the other healthcare professionals would contact PCF T in order to arrange for hm to have a
bed at one of ther units unless one became available in GMMH. In the interim the deceased
indicated his wilingness mental health services. The deceased discussed his case again

‘next MOT meeting on the morning of February The psychiainat understood that no bed — |

‘was available but not that the search fora bed had been discontinued or the reasons why
but felt that m the absence of an avaiable bed his care could be managed unti Monday 11th
‘of February when the position could be reassessed The psychiatrist was not informed on 7
February that GMMH healthcare professionals have been in contact with PCFT but who had
‘apparently requested further information before considering the request bed and those
healthcare professionals decided to abandon the attempt to secure a bed because of the
deceased's apparent cooperation This was a lost opportunty to have reconsidered the
‘position and pursue other arrangements or escalate the issue

‘On the 8 February the psychiatnst was not updated and told ofthe accurate position The
‘deceased's father received a phone call from his son mid-morning on that day and he
returned the call although was aware from a previous conversation that his son had been
‘advised not to drive a motor car but assured him that he could have the folowing weak off
work without any difficulty His parents lived in Norfok but his father drove to Manchester in
‘order to collect him and take him home for his own welfare and safety En-route to
‘Manchester at about 4 30 PM he discovered that his son posted on Facebook that he was
intending to take his own life. He asked his wife to contact GMMH wind and adwsed to
Contact the police A concer forthe deceased's welfare was raised and his father went to
the building ste where his working and met police officers at that location at about 6.30 pm
and facilitated their entry into the ste but also saw his son dead hanging from a ligature
Understandably extremely distressed and traumatised by what he had seen The poice
searched the deceased local home and found a number of notes to close members of his
{family and from those an inference could be drawn that he wished to take his own ife

‘Subsequently, GMMH cared out a serious incident investigation produced a detailed report
“The investigation was charred by a mental health nurse but did not have a consultant
psychuatnst on the investigation team The investigation itself discovered that apparently
PCFT wanted further information i order to consider the request bed provided by them but
he did nat discover exactly what information was requested although this s clearly extremely
relevant No contact was made with the appropriate level of management within PCFT to
discover this and nor was this issue escalated to senior management withn GMMH The
report itslf which was bound to be disclosed to the deceased's family did not use plain
‘simple English to descnbe its relevant findings and in particular thatthe treating psychiatrist
hhad not been made aware ofthe decision by other healthcare professionals to abandon the
search for a bed and so lost the opportunity to make other alternative arrangements which
were cinically appropnate In addition to provide the deceased with a safe and supervised
environment In practical terms we psychiatrist decision to admit the deceased to hospital,
‘was overruled but without advising the psyctuatrist and nor was it brought to her attention on
the moming of 8 February

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concer. In my
‘opinion there 1s a nsk that future deaths will occur unless action s taken In the
Carcumstances its my statutory duty to report to you

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows

5.1. The failure by GMMH to expedite the search for and secunng an mpabent bed wich a
consultant psychiatnst has cinically decided was appropnate to provide a safe and
‘supervised environment for ongong assessment and treatment for a patient wth a
‘senous diagnosed mental disorder who had made a very recent attempt to kil
themselves. This vill also require haison with PCFT because both trusts will come into
contact with one another quite regularly

| suggest policies and procedures involved need reviewing and updating as necessary 50
‘they work expecitously when required and also deal with other healthcare
‘organisations that are or may become involved

'52 There was a falure by GMM to fully and properiy discover and record urgently orn a
timely manner exactly what information was apparently required by PCFT in order to
faciitate the provision of a bed. Consequently, there was no opportunty to provide that
Information and secure in bed which may been available when the deceased had
‘agreed to become an inpatient He was therefore out of hospital and not n a safe and
superwsed location when he kiled himself

Its suggested that enquines of PCFT or any other mental health trust or healthcare
provider in similar circumstances needs to be expedited and proper records Kept In
‘addition poliies, guidance or protocols need to be introduced or updated to deal with
ths

53 The decision to abandon the search for a bed was taken by healthcare professionals.
vithout knowledge of exactly what information, if any, PCFT required to consider the
request and without updating the psychiatrist in charge of the deceased care n order
{or them to consider and reassess the positon This appears to be a wholly
inappropriate and unsatisfactory postion

Itis suggested gudance, policies or protocols should be introduced to ensure that cinical
‘decisions made by psychiatnsts are not overruled or not pursued by other healthcare
professionals when the chnical decision had been made as to the care and
management of a patent,

‘54 If its not possible to change or ater the ""out of area"" catchment area for mental health
trusts then GMMH and PCFT should ensure that there are quick and reliable methods
‘of communication between to secure a bed as soon as possible If either trust requires,
further mformation this too 1s communicated quickly, recorded and obtained if possible
‘nd the trust seeking a placement can make alternatwe arrangements urgently

{is suggested that whatever arrangements currently exist between the trusts they are
reviewed and updated and allow for urgent escalation to senior management of ether
‘or both trusts

55 There cid not appear to be any speciic guidance , polcy or protocol to assist
healthcare staff n advising patients to stop driving motor vehicles or using machinery
\Whist in a mental health criss (n accordance with any DVLA guidance that exists)
hich may put themselves or others at nsk of death or serious harm

{tis suggested that this needs to be reviewed an addressed as soon as possible

{56 There wore falures inthe post death investigation process which may result in the true
Cercumstances not bemg identified and steps taken to prevent continuation of

Tecurrence of circumetances which may cause or contnbute to a fulure death

tis suggested that the trusts own investigation process needs to be reviewed and
‘amended

‘ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

Inmy opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and | believe you and your
‘organisation have the power to take such action.

[At Mr Moody's Inquest | heard that his family (who wer p foverts 2s

inlay called 009 and asked forthe Police to attend. The the cal

8s requring the atendance of Ambulance Senice and deemed this to be a malter tat
the Police would not attend. This resulted in the family having to redial 909 and ask for
{an alternative service; during which some level of serening questions were repeated
“This caused delay n the family reaching an approprate service to attend

| Ungar evidence from the Medtal Health Lead for Hampshire Constabulary who
| exsiained that asthe incident onthe 19"" Apri 2019 was occurring inthe person's home
‘and, as such the Police have no power oinervane wire a person sin hel own home

| Aarl, asthe incident onthe 18% had occured in a publc place and so, in that case, the
| police had a duty to attend
""head further evidence that there's a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
‘between Hampshire Polce andthe South Central Ambulance Service as to who isthe
[prmary response agency for persons making threats of suis ideation.
LUrumately, the famiy were confused as to where help would come from and the cal-

| handler wil not transfer the cal o a particular roue/servce uriess the caller makes the
<ecision aso which service they need. Despite there boing a MOU batwoon the
‘agencies this does not appear ta be something thatthe general ble is aware of, and
the task of making the gonoral pubic aware ofthis i ikely to be Ineveountable and
therefore it remains entrely foreseeable that future delays could ooour because calers
‘are unaware of which emergency service isthe correct one to request in a situation
where a person is suffering a mental heath crisis epsode andlor expressing Sicidal

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

‘On 11th June 2019 | commenced an investigation into the death of Steven Keith
‘Marsiand. The investigation concluded on the 18"" November 2019 and the
‘conclusion was one of Suicide. The medical cause of death was 1a) Hanging

@ | CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

‘Steven Marsland had a complex mental health background. He was
sectioned under the Mental Health Act for bipolar disorder which had led
to.@ manic episode with psychotic symptoms. On 9th April 2019 he was
discharged from the Section 3 and was to reside in the community with
‘support from the Community Mental Health Team (CMH). He was.
prescribed sodium valproate. There was one follow up face-to-face
‘meeting with the CMHT on 15th April 2019. There were 4 telephone
‘conversations with the CMHT between discharge and his death on 10th
June 2019,

(On 31st May 2019 he cancelled his appointment fora face-to-face
| meeting. 4 further meeting was not arranged. The CMHT did not engage
with his family following his discharge from his Section 3. A follow up
‘outpatient appointment with a psychiatrist was not made after his
discharge. His family felt he was more withdrawn. On 10th June 2019 he
‘was found suspended from a ligature in a wooded area adjacent to
‘Ashlon Golf Club. It was a location known to him through family fishing
‘outings. There were no suspicious circumstances or evidence of third
Party involvement.

3” | CORONER'S CONCERNS

‘During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matiers giving rise to |
‘concern. In my opinion there is a risk that fulure deaths will occur unless action
is taken. in the circumstances i is my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

1. The inquest heard that his family were very supportive and had attended
[MDT meetings whilst he was an in-patient. Following his discharge there
was no attempt to engage his family and obtain information from them or
‘work with them fo support him in the community. There was no clear
policy about how a family could be effectively engaged by the CMHT;

2. The inquest heard that he was treated as an in-patient by the Pennine
Care team within Stockport MBC. His consultant whilst he was an in-
patient was part ofthe Stockport Team. Ifhe had been a Stockport
Resident he would have been discharged under the care of that |
Consultant inthe community and had a follow up appointment booked
with that Doctor at discharge. However because he was a Tameside
Resident at discharge his care moved to the Tameside Borough Pennine
Care Team. That meant he had to be allocated to a community
‘psychiatrist based there. That did not happen and no folow up
‘appointment was made;

3. The inquest heard that it was recognised as part of his discharge |
planning that there should be regular contact in the community with the
‘CMHT. That did not happen and there was no escalation or discussion
about the picture of very limited contact as itevolved post discharge.

perceived lack of engagement by the agencies involved in her care to find
practical solutons to help her with her physical health needs. These
included the provision of a ramp. She ultimately decided she would prfer

‘S| CORONER'S CONCERNS:
During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In
ry opinion there is a risk that future deaths wil occur unless action is taken. In the
(reumetances iis my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

1. Evidence emerged during the inquest that thore was inconsistent sharing of
documentation and case notes between the agencies involved.

2. Thero was a lack ofa joint Mental Health Trust and social care packages for
patients with complex physical healh needs or opportunities to convene mull-
‘agency meetings.

3. Thore was a lack of information gathering prior to the visit to see Ms Alam by the
Social workers on the day she Gied. No contact was made with the Mental
Health ust and no assessment took pace,

4. The Local authosly housing officers did recognise the escalating risk in her
‘mental health state but the mechanism for urgent rteral via the safeguarding
team and GP was  siow and cumbersome process which didnt work.

@ | ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action shouldbe taken to provent future deaths and I believe you have the
power to take such action.

[IL1: PROTECT]

1. All agencies involved may wish to consider reviewing their approaches to
sharing of information and approaches to multidisipinary isk assessments for
patients with these complex needs.

2. Sacial Services may wish to consider reviewing their training for the social
workers involved and the importance of obtaining accurate and up to date
Information prior to any vist

3. The Mental Health Trust in conjunction with the local authority may wish to
consider reviewing their joint agency protocols and developing multi-agency
protocols to leam from this age nedent

or any further face to face discussion with Katie or assessment

concluded Katie was being safeguarded. A child and famiy

‘On 18"" December 2018 Katie disclosed to her form teacher that,
‘she was considering self-harm or worse. A cause for concen
form was completed but subsequently misplaced, Action was

| taken to notify her parents of Katie's disclosure and her mother
was spoken to. Katie had previously self-harmed. No further
action was taken in relation to this disclosure. On 8° January
2019 Katie sent her previous form teacher, who had left the
‘school, a message via social media. She said she had no one
else to talk to who knew what she was feeling and that she
thought about the abuse every day and had cut herself the day
before. The message was shared with the school safeguarding
lead that evening and Katie was spoken to at schoo! the
following day. She denied sending the message.

‘She continued with lessons. School attempted to notify her
family of the concer. After school she retumed home. As a
result of concems raised by one of her friends school were
‘contacted and contact was made with her family who tried to
contact her and check on her wellbeing. Her friend went to check
fon her and found Katie suspended from a ligature at her home
address.

| ‘She was resuscitated and taken to hospital. However she had
sustained catastrophic brain damage and died at Royal
Manchester Children’s Hospital on 18th January 2019.

CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise
to concer. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur
Unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to
report to you,

| The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —
1, The inquest was told that GMP followed their own guidance which

accorded with that of the College of Policing into the level of
expertise of the officer allocated to investigate Kate's allegations.
‘AS a resul ofthis the case was not dealt with by an experienced
Public Protection or specialist sexual offences trained officer. It
was allocated to a probationary police constable with
approximately 6 months experience. The officer did not seize the
phone which contained key social media contents until her third
Visit on the initial evening the offence was disclosed. The allocated
officer was not experienced in joint working with social services or
{familiar with the concept ofthe voice of the child and what it would
mean in such a case. At the time the decision was made by police
{to NFA matters there was no discussion about whether there could

bbe a victimiess prosecution; itwas not established ifthe initial
account was recorded on body worn footage or the extent of the
social media contact by the suspect and the nature of any offences
that could be revealed by those messages. No attempt was made
to have a further face to face conversation with Katie;

. The Local Authority at the time were using a substantial number of
agency social workers. As a result the Child and Family
Assessment was not completed in accordance with best practice |
‘and not shared in accordance with expectations around best

ractice. The Local Authority has since made significant progress
in moving away from a reliance on agency staf to fil gaps in social

‘work cover. The inquest was told that agency social workers are |

siil used extensively in other Local Authorities creating a risk that

a similar situation could arise;

3. At the safeguarding strategy meeting an officer allocated to attend
such meetings on behalf of GMP attended rather than an officer
allocated to the case. As a result the quality of information sharing
and understanding of the allegation was more limited. On the
particular police division in question this practice has stopped. It
‘was unclear how common the approach is on a wider basis;

|. Itwas accepted by witnesses for both the Local Authority and
GMP that the voice of the child was not fully heard throughout their
investigations. They via the safeguarding board commissioned an
lependent report whose findings and recommendations have
been fully adopted by the safeguarding board. It was unclear what
if any steps would be taken to disseminate the lessons pan GM or
rationally;

further concem identified was that there was no mechanism for
the schoo! to be formally be aware of information within the Child
and Family Assessment. As a result there was no formal follow-up
procedure set out in the best practice national guidance the schoo!
was working within. The inquest heard that Katie's school
recognising this gap has built on the working together guidance to
develop guidance that ensures there is a proactive approach to
‘engaging with a child and their family post the writing of a Child
and Family Assessment;

‘On the day Katie committed suicide she had attended a GCSE |
English class. The exam board required poetry syllabus was being
studied that day. The lesson included a poem where the
Ccontextualisation of it included the use of suicide. The teacher
delivering the lesson had no way of understanding the history of
self-harm of Katie and her particular vulnerability when delivering a

CORONER’S LEGAL POWERS

I make this report under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009,

paragraph 7, Schedule 5, and
The Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013,
regulations 28 and 29.

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

On 12th June 2019 | commenced an investigation into the
death of Julius Jake Little aged 20. The investigation
concluded at the end of the inquest on 9th October 2019. |
made a determination at inquest of suicide, recording that;

""At 1.03 am on 7th June 2019 Julius Jake little was found’
unresponsive in his room in student halls of residence. A self
applied ligature secured to a wardrobe clothes rail was tied
around his neck. Despite efforts to resuscitate him, life was
pronounced extinct at 02.03.""

The medical cause of death was recorded as;

""1.4 suspension by ligature”

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Mr Little was a first year undergraduate at UAL living in halls of
residence. On 7th June 2019 he was found hanging from a belt
attached to a clothes rail in his wardrobe. Mr Little had a
history of depression and was receiving treatment in the form
of psychotherapy and medication overseen by a psychiatrist

CORONER’S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed
matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk
that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the
circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN ate as follows.

In the course of hearing an inquest at Poplar Coroner's Court
on 9/10/19 into the death of Julius Jake Little, evidence was
considered in relation to available support services offered to
undergraduates at UAL who have a history of mental health
problems.

The Dean of Students at UAL mm. gave

evidence that applicants to UAL make an online application to
the admissions organisation UCAS. The application invites
them to disclose any history they have of mental health
problems, upon being accepted on a course of study this
information is provided to the admitting university.

Wl MMM indicated that the mental health disclosure
information is used to target students that may require support,
and at UAL emails are sent to undergraduates, inviting them to
register with the university's support services.

Regrettably, it would appear that of UAL’s cohort of students
that disclosed mental health problems to UCAS, only 66% of
undergraduates responded to the email invitation offering
mental health support. The remaining 33%, a total of some 200
students, did not respond to the offer.

| asked (NE whether the identity of students who had
made a mental health disclosure in their UCAS application
was communicated to tutors and halls of residence staff at the
university. | was informed that this information was not so
disseminated as it would be breach of data protection
legislation, this appears to be a missed opportunity.

| cannot suggest a solution to this problem, however it does
appear to be a lost opportunity to secure this valuable
information but not to utilise it effectively.

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths
and | believe that your organisation have the power to take
such action.

YOUR RESPONSE
You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of
the date of this report, namely by 23rd December 2019. |, the
coroner, may extend the period.

Your response _must contain details of action taken or

proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action.
Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed.

bis death, Mr. Kirsch had been the subject of an ACCT document since 201.18.

3 | CORONER'S CONCERNS

‘During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concer, In
im opinion there is @ risk that future deaths will occur unless actions taken. inthe
cercumstances its my statutory duty to repor to you,

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows, —

(1) No Case Manager nad been allocated to oversee Mr. Kirsch's ACCT document.
‘Ths lack of oversight resulted in a number of Geficlencies in the ACCT process,
inouding
(@) 11 diferent people chairing the 13 ACCT reviews which took place in the 6
Weeks between Mr. Kirsch reum from hospital on 62 18 and his death on
19318

(©) Inadequate completion of the Caremap within the ACCT document, which
‘ought fo have highlighted the issues behing Mr. Krsch's concerning
‘behaviour and suicide attempis in January 2018, and kentiled acbons t be
{aken to try to address those issues. In this case, evidence was heard that
() When he had first started his sentence in 2008, Mr. Kirsch had tos,

people that he would not live to complete it;

yn August 2017 he had had two notable episodes of bizarre behaviour _|

‘which, it was thought. may have been down to Paving taken te]
/eychoactive substance Spice

(ii) Evidence ftom stat who had winessed the suicide attempts in January
2018 Indicated that they thought he may have taken Spice on those
‘ocasions,

(jv) Throughout 2017 and early 2018 he had been rather obsessed wih a
‘complaint ne nad made about an enty on his NOMIS recor, and that
inthe days leading up to his death he had reported tha this had been
‘keeping him up at right

(v)_ He was concerned that his daughter, who had become an adult
felatvely recently, had not tied fo make contact with him,

(Wi) He was worried about visits from his famiy. and how he was going to
tellthem what he had done in January 2018,

(vi) He had been involved in aight on 133.18 with another prisoner
(something out of character for him ), which had resuited in his transfer
to ancther wing, away from a fellow prisoner who was an important part
‘of his support network:

(vi) He had recenty sought outa member ofthe healthcare team in tears,
‘because he was worried that he had not been able to get across his,
version of events inthe adjudication hearing hes after the fight, |
inidont,

(&) One atemoon of his death, two felow prisoners had expressed
‘concerns toa Supervising Officer that Mr. Kirsch was ""ooking
Partculary down’ and was not rimsef. This conversaton was passed
‘onto the Supervising Officer on Mr. Kic's wing who spoke to fn. In
that conversation, Mr. Kirsch made a concerning comment about
having bien someone, and dened (unirutully) that he had had any
Involvement withthe mental heath team at the prson. These concems
{and conversations were not recorded anywhere inthe main body ofthe
ACCT document

‘Save forthe fact of he fight on 13.3 18 and of his resulting transfer to

‘another wing, none of these matters was noted i the Caremap on Mr.

Kirsc's ACCT document, and so no actions were identified to try to acess

them

(©) The ACCT document was opened on 201.18. Between then and 52.18 Mr.
‘crsch had been receiving veaent fr hi jue in hospital and had |
‘been on constant bedwatch there. When he retumed tothe prison on
5.2.18, noentres were made to the Caremap at al forthe Fst four weeks

have signed of the fst page of the Caremap using rials,

(2) Despite the ACCT document having been open for more than 6 weeks, twas |
‘not escalated to a more senior member of staf, as per prison poly.

(4) Some prison officers appeared to have had a worrying lack of knowledge ofthe
easons for the ACCT document being opened, and ofthe issues set out therein
hich needed to be montored. By way of example:

(a) the Supervising Officer on Mr. Kirsch's wing who had the conversation with
him described at 1(0Xx) above, was nat aware that DK had atlemted
suicide twice in January 2018, and had not realised that Mr. Kirsch was
being unruthful about his volvement withthe mental heath team

{(®) another Supervising Officer who had conducted an earlier ACCT review on

8.2.18 also conceded in evidence that atthe time he conducted the review.

Tie had ""probably not hed any iea about the wo suicide atempts the
| previous month

(6) The Supervising Officer who conducted the last ACCT review on 163.18
conceded in evidence tat, inthe course of that review, he may not have asked
‘Me. Kirsch about his state of mind or whether he was having any thoughts of

| Ssulcide or se-harm. When asked how he had proposed to assess Mr. Kisch’s

level of risk and to complete the Caremap, he stated that he would have done

parent and that he was dying from an overdose of morphine (Oramorph) he had
taken which was prescribed to him,

His father rang East Midlands Ambulance Service to request an ambulance for
his son in Comwall. In error, the ambulance was directed to his father's address

",631,"1. The dispatch of the ambulance to the wrong address was a fundamental error that could potentially lead to future deaths if not addressed.
2. The coroner is concerned about the steps taken by the East Midlands Ambulance Service to prevent similar errors in the future and requests confirmation of any audits done to ensure sufficient measures are in place.","On 14/4/18, lan Thomas Trevor Bean died from multi-drug toxicity and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Mr. Bean became agitated and distressed at his home address, contacted his father to inform him that he had taken an overdose of morphine, and requested an ambulance. However, the ambulance was mistakenly directed to his father's address in Nottingham instead of Mr. Bean's location in Cornwall. Despite this error, it was determined that the dispatch mistake did not directly cause Mr. Bean's death by suicide.

3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(On 18% October 2018 | commenced an investigation into the death of
Oliver Sharp. The investigation concluded on the 20"" September 2019
and the conclusion was one of: Narrative: Suicide contributed to by a
failure by mental health services to recognise the increasing level of
risk he presented as he transitioned from child and adolescent
‘mental health services into the reduced provision and support
available post 16.

‘The medical cause of death was 1a) Heroin Overdose

“@ CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH
Oliver Richard Sharp was a year ahead of his chronological age
at school and excelled academically. Whilst at Manchester
Grammar Schoo! he began to change his approach to schoo!
and his friends. He disclosed to a CBT therapist the extent of
how he was struggling with how he felt about himself and his
friendships. On 17% April 2016 he disclosed he was self-
harming. On 21* April 2016 he saw the GP and was referred to
CAMHS. On 25"" April 2016 Oliver took 48 Paracetamol tablets

‘and disclosed that to his family who took him to Stepping Hill
Hospital. He retumed to school and continued under CAMHS.
He was put on a 6 month waiting list for an ADOS assessment,
‘which took place in November 2016 and was inconclusive.

In September 2016 he returned to year 11 at Manchester
Grammar School. He was struggling to cope with the academic
‘demands and there was a focus on trying to help him catch up
‘academically and keep him safe, He showed signs of becoming
‘concemed about falling and struggled to cope with friendship
‘groups, The delayed ADOS assessment indicated he was not
autistic.

He continued to self-harm over Christmas 2016, and on 24
January 2017 he took an overdose of paracetamol and was
admitted to Stepping Hil Hospital. t was agreed with CAMHS
that a 2nd opinion would be sought about him. The psychiatric
‘assessment identified a complex picture including ficulties with
‘emotional literacy and empathy. The overall diagnosis was of
Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD), ADHD and Emotional
Behavioural Dysregulation.

Following his January overdose, work continued with CAMHS
land he retumed to school. He became increasingly isolated and
by the time of GCSEs he took only English and Maths but did not
answer the papers. He left Manchester Grammar School and
transferred to Beech Hall Schoo! in September 2017, dropping
bback to a year below his chronological age to repeat year 10.
‘Over summer 2017 he began to work with the Autism Team and
they helped support him into Beech Hall School.

In October 2017 he went missing from home and was found on a
‘motorway bridge at Sam. He had not been taking his medication.
Family therapy and sessions with his case manager continued.
‘There were discussions about post 16 provision as he
approached his 16th Birthday. CAMHS within Stockport is a
service for children up to 16. Discussions regarding discharge:
continued and because of the way in which Mental Health
‘Services were structured the plan was to discharge to the GP.
Overall he had settled at Beech Hall, although attendance was
erratic. In June 2018 the last family therapy session was due to
take place. He had gone missing from home.

(On 12"" June 2018 he presented at Manchester Royal Infirmary
‘seeking help having slept rough in Manchester and reporting
thoughts of suicide. He was discharged to CAMHS for follow up.
On 14 June 2018 he told Beech Hall he was likely to harm

fimseififhe went home. They took him o Macclesfield ABE)
\where a detailed assessment and gathering of information
resulted in him being admited on a voluntary basis tothe Hope

He arrived there at tam on 15% June. He did not lke it. He was
‘assessed and was allowed to leave the unit on 15th June.
Following further psychiatric assessment from the unit whist in
the community he was placed on quetiapine. Concordance was.
initially good but deteriorated. The planned discharge from the
Hope Unit services took place on 2° July 2018. On 2° July
2018 he went missing from home and was found at Crewe
Railway Station. The CAMHS plan was to discharge him and
‘move him to the transition team which was discussed on 20""
‘August 2018. He was to have a new therapist.

(On 24"" August 2018 he went missing from home. He was found
and taken to Stepping Hill Hospital and assessed by RAID. He
had bought paracetamol with the intention of taking his life. He
expressed concem about his discharge from CAMHS. He was
discharged to see CAHMS on 31% August 2018. He was due to
return to Beech Hall on 5 September 2018.

(On 5"" September he was reported as missing from home. He
‘was found by a member ofthe public in the early hours of the
‘morning having taken an overdose of heroin. Medical
intervention reversed the outcome of the overdose. He was
assessed by the RAID team. There was a failure to consider the
{ull circumstances of his history and a failure by mental health
providers involved in his care to effectively communicate. As a
result the level of risk he presented was not adequately
Understood. He was discharged to the Home Treatment Team.
‘The Home Treatment Team saw him on 13 September 2018,
Professionals in his care recognised the increasing isk in
{elation to his behaviour. The Home Treatment Team failed to
appreciate the level of risk he presented.

‘On the evening of 14 September 2018 he presented at ABE at
‘Stepping Hill Hospital wth suicidal ideation. He was seen and
assessed by RAID. There was a failure to fully assess him or
understand the complexities and level of risk he presented. He
was discharged home into the community to see the Home
Treatment Team on 15% September 2018. He saw the Home
Treatment Team on 15%, 18° and 30 September 2018. On 30""
‘September he was discharged from the Home Treatment Tear.
(On 8"" October at schoo! he appeared to accept the reduced
academic aspirations for him. A further reduced academic

Timetable was sent to him on 12"" October 2018.
‘On 17% October 2018 he went missing from home. This was
reported to Greater Manchester Police. On the morning of 18""
‘October 2018 he was found by a dog walker in Gatley Hil. A
typed note was found on him. He was taken to Wythenshawe
Hospital and his death was confirmed. Toxicology confirmed that
he had taken a fatal dose of heroin.

CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise
to concer. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur
Unless action is taken. In the circumstances itis my statutory duty to
report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

‘The inquest was told that the provision of mental health services post 16
varies widely across the country. In some areas there is a CAMHS 16-25
mental health service provision similar to the national 16 and under
service whereas in other areas there a limited transition service or move
back to primary care for re-referral to adult services. The inquest was told
that this creates a cliff edge high risk situation for adolescents. The
reason for the difference was resources and decisions taken by CCGs.

‘The inquest was told that itis important for autism to be diagnosed 2s
erly 2s possible so that appropriate support can be putin place. Early
diagnosis was impacted by a national picture of long waiting lists for
ADOS assessments. In Stockport there was approximately a 6 month
waiting list for assessment. This was against a national picture of 12-24
month waits in some areas.

During the inquest evidence was heard that acceleration ahead of a
chronological schoo! age might cause relatively few difficulties in peer
relationships up to about year 9 but post that as children entered
adolescence it could become a significant issue impacting a child's
mental health and ability to cope. Where it did happen, there needed to
be an understanding by schools of the risks and early signs indicating a
need for additional support to try to reduce the likelihood of self-harming
behaviours and the potential need for additional support.

‘The inquest heard that Oliver had found the autism label and the label of
isabiliy that was attached to it vey dificult to accept as time went on.
‘There was evidence that particularly with high achieving children with
autism the idea that they had a disability created additional challenge.

‘The language that it would have been more helpful to use widely would
have been difference rather than disability

23s to who wae to undertake the astesement between Wala MBC and Birmingham Cty Counc
In addon there wae a lack of exources to enable the aeessmen to be carried out na timely
‘manne. This meant the assessment was cried out ust few hours before the time period for
the 5(2) wasto expire

2. Evidence atte Inquest rom the approved Mental heath practitioner confirmed that key
Information and documentation were ether unavalable and/or not asked for during the mental
health act assessment on 16/06/19. was unable to confirm which atthe Inquest. This meant
‘the te nature of Mi Dundha's ong term condition was nat known and the assessors were
unable ta se the “bigger picture” The delay n arranging the aeessment contributed to the

Tack of avaiable nformavon:

3. When Mr Oundhal was admitted to hospital on 15/03/19 he was placed on S2 ofthe Mental
Health Act when his lineal team had specially recommended he be placed on $3. No
explanation was avaiable for this. Evidence atthe inquest suggested ths was a decision made

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

During almost 40 years siting as a Coroner, Senior Coroner and now Assistant
Coroner, I have heard numerous inguests where had there been communication
between the doctors, nurses and therapists caring for patients with mental
health issues, and the close relatives of those patients, many issues might have
been explained and lives saved.

“The reason given in the present case, as in so many others, is that of patient

confidentiality,

Whilst the medical authorities are usually right in their interpretation, one
wonders whether some form of enquiry/commission might be established to
review the law on confidentiality and especially where it interfaces with those
Patients who have ‘capacity’ but where their relatives have valuable information
Which could help doctors decide on best care and treatment.

In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I
believe you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action.

to attach copies of those documents. They are the statement cf 0o:i A

‘coupled withthe Level 2 Comprehensive Serious incident Review Report A study of
those two documents will give the history and itcan be seen that al avaiable in-patient

Foundation Trust (the Mental Health Services) simply had no other option but o detain
‘him in hospital oro discharge him. He had been providing drugs to other in-patient
hospital and so understandably they dit not want him to continue there, They therefore
ischarged him withthe ful knowledge that ne would immediately proceed to ty to take

take was to telephone the Beachy Head Chaplain and the Police to war them that

Investigation and Inquest

(On 22 May 2018 | commenced an investigation into the death of Alistair Patrick

McDonald, aged 19 The investigation concluded atthe end of the inquest on 5 June
2019,

‘The cause of death was found to be
1a Hanging

The conclusion of the inquest was Surcide.
Circumstances of death

‘The deceased was born on 17 February 1999 and lived in Malvern, Worcestershire
with his parents, together with his two brothers He did not suffer any significant
physical health conditon orilnesses He was a high achiever academically

When he was about 16 years old his mother leamed from his then girfrend that he
was expressing very disturbing thoughts His outlook on life and his future seemed
very troubled On becoming aware of this, his school suggested that he might
consult the ‘Relate Counselling Service’, but he did not find this helpful and so with
the assistance of his parents, he consulted his GP, who was anxious to make an
urgent referral to the local CAMHS.

He disclosed he was expenencing sutcidal ideation, which he repeated when seeing
his GP practice in March 2016. The initial referral by hss GP was made on 19
January 2016 and he did have a history of infctng deliberate sel-harm The result
Of this CAMHS referral was that he could be supported by the ‘Healthy Minds
Service’ A second GP referral was made due to the disclosed specific suicidal
intent

He was assessed on 12 April 2016 and confrmed his suicidal thoughts, but it did not
appear that the wider perspective of a young man who had just turned 17 readily
admitting to suicidal ideation, despite his superficial presentation, was recognised as
‘unusual and disturbing It was suggested that he should consider CBT for his
anxiety via the Healthy Minds Service, but it was felt that he did not meet the cnteria
for CAMHS intervention,

He did not apparently have an assessment by a consuitant psychiatrist, but what
was described as a locum CAMHS senor practitoner’. A letter was writen to the
deceased on 26 Apni 2016 indicating that he did not meet the ‘criteria for CAMHS at
present’ This acknowledged dificultes in communicating with the deceased and his
mother. However, on one interpretation he could have met the cntena set out in a
policy document There cid not appear to be any clear advice as to what to do
‘should his suicidal feelings persist and that any help he might receive from the
Healthy Minds Service was not successful

‘There did not appear to be any recognition that he could present a superficially
postive state of mind, whereas in reality subject to more detailed assessment by a
psychiatrist that might not have been the true picture

‘There was never any follow-up to check on his progress

In 2017 Alastair came to Manchester to study for a degree in Music. Whilst in
Manchester, he disclosed to a friend that he was struggling with depression and he
‘was found by his fend on a vist to be actively self-harming He was encouraged to
seek help as he was clearly having difficulties of a serious nature in coping with day
to day life He did not disciose to his parents his detenoratng state of mental health
and he had no point of contact back to CAMHS or other psychiatric services,

(On 14 May 2018 he was found dead, hanging by a ligature secured to a door frame

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving nse to

taken. In the circumstances it s my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The matters of concem are as follows.

unsuccessful

3. The opportunity to take a broader view of the whole position and have an

were unsuccessful and her BMI was 13.6 kgim2 by 4 December 2017.

‘On the 5 December 2017, she was admitted to the Eating Disorder Unit
| (EDU). She was a patient there until her discharge on the 22% May 2018

when her BM was 17.3 kg/m2. Formal psychology sessions had not
started until 23 March 2018 because the Eating Disorder Unit did not
have a psychologist in post.
Throughout her time in EDU Hannah expressed suicidal ideation which
fluctuated. On the 22% May 2018, she was discharged into the
community. No discharge plan was sent o the GP. On the 25"" May
2018 a close family member died. At the final psychology appointment
‘on the 29"" May 2018, she described specific methods she had
considered to end her life including overdose. The barrier to that being
insufficient medication. Her mental health had clearly deteriorated and
her suicidal ideation increased. There was a failure to communicate the
detail ofthis to her family or the prescribing GP. This probably
‘contributed to Hannah taking, on the 31"" May 2018, a large overdose of
ther medication prescribed by her GP who had not been notified of her
suicide risk by the Eating Disorder Unit or been asked by the EDU to
Prescribe in a way that would reduce risk.
| Hannah was assessed by the RAID team, following the refusal of the
Eating Disorder Unit Team to accept her back. A decision was made to
place Hannah in an adult acute psychiatric bed.
‘local NHS bed was not available and she was placed at The Priory in
Cheadle on the 7® June 2018. The Mental Health Trust did not appoint a
Care Co-Ordinator until prompted by the Priory on the 13 June 2018,
The Care Co-Ordinator did not engage effectively with Hannah, her family
or The Priory.
Hannah did not improve at The Priory. Her psychiatrist there identified
that it was not the most appropriate place for her and wanted her to go to
the EDU. The EDU took a different view. Hannah's weight did not
improve. Her anorexic thoughts did not improve. The consequence of
this was that her suicidal ideation increased as her feelings of
hopelessness increased. The placement of her in a setting not equipped
to effectively deal with her severe anorexia has probably contributed to
her death. The Priory did not request her notes from the EDU, particularly
her counselling notes and as a result, they were not fully sighted of the
specifics of her previously expressed thoughts of suicide. As a result, the
level of risk in her leaving the unit whilst her mental health was.
deteriorating was not fuly assessed. This has probably contributed to her
death
‘On the 12% July 2018, Hannah went to the first floor cafe at John Lewis,
‘Cheadle with her parents. The height ofthe balustrade was such that
‘once she was on a table she was able to jump from the café to the
| ground floor suffering catastrophic injuries. She died at Salford Royal
Hospital on 13” July 2018 from her injuries.

CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise
to concem. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur
unless action is taken. In the circumstances itis my statutory duty to
report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:-

1-The inquest heard that discharge planning including communication
with GPs and families around risk was not effective. Key information was
not shared with the GP or the family particularly when care moved back
to the family;

2. There was no clear evidence of consideration of discharge medication
‘and risk around prescribing of medication post discharge from the EDU.
‘As a result Hannah was prescribed a month's supply of medication;

3. The suitability of acute mental health beds for young adults and lack of
alternative provision The inquest heard that Hannah went to an acute
‘adult psychiatric bed because the EDU felt that it was the wrong
‘environment for her and there was no other alternative. The inquest
heard that there were concems regarding the placement of a young adult
in such a setting and how frightening it was to her;

4, Communication with private providers by NHS trusts once mental
health trusts have placed individuals in private settings. During the time
that Hannah was placed at the Priory the mental health trust who placed
her did not have any discussion with Hannah, her family or the Priory
regarding the placement. A care coordinator had been allocated by the
‘Trust once requested by the Priory but no care coordination had taken
place;

5.The expectations around information sharing with private providers and
the expectation on private providers contracted by the NHS to seek
information. The Priory did not request any notes from the EDU about
Hannah. As a result they were unaware of detailed information held by
the Trust regarding previously expressed suicidal ideation;
6. Understanding and communication by the Priory about the change in

risk level when Hannah moved from a secure environment to periods of
time outside the unit in the care of her family;

7. The inquest was told by the clinical lead for Eating Disorders of the
high risk of Eating Disorders in high achieving students on courses such
‘as medicine. In such cases, the inquest was told universities need to be
alert to early signs of anxiety that risk leading to eating disorders
developing. As par of this understanding by universities the inquest was
{old of the need to recognise early signs of mental health issues and
listen carefully from an early stage. The skill settraining of academics in
welfare roles in relation to mental health was described as key and
specific work with Eating Disorder services and training of those involved
in welfare programmes supporting students can be effective;

£8. The guidance in elation to the height of glass balustrades where
items such as tables, in cafes open to the public including children and
cother vulnerable people, are placed in close proximity to the glass. The

‘glass balustrade in John Lewis was at a height that accorded with the
required standard but by simply climbing onto the table that was adjacent
to the balustrade Hannah was able to easily go over the balustrade.

‘ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

3 INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(0n.07/04/2017 | commenced an investigation into the death of Sasha Sabrina FORSTER aged 20.
‘The investigation concluded atthe end of the inquest on 23 May 2019. The conclusion ofthe
inquest was that Sasha died as the resi of suicide, folowing her dalverate ingestion ofa fatal
(overdose of Propranal tablets

4 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

(1) Sasha was a young woman who had struggled for many years with a numberof mental health
orders, and had been under the care of mental health services sines early adolescence, Her
fiagnoses ware
(i) severe Obsessive Compulsive Disorder
(i) complex Post Traumatic Stass Disorder
(i) Autistic Spectrum Disorder (although the resis of the assessment which confirmed

this clagnosie ware not avalable unl after Sasha's death)
() traits of Emotionally Unstable Personally Disorder although this was strongly
Aisputed by Sasha and her famiy )

(2) Sasha hada lengty history of sel-harm, both through cuting herself and through taking
alberate overdoses of paracetamol. More recently, she had taken a numberof overdoses of
Propranolol (2 rug which she had managed to source despite it not being prescribed to he.
‘and whien in overdose carmed a signcant risk of death ona such overdose in January 2017
had resulted in her suflering a near-fatal cardiac arrest.

(8) Sasha's OCO meant thal she remained at risk even when detained in hospital under the
“Mental Heath Act 1983. This is because she felt compelled to rafuse food or drink provided to
her, and any resulting applcation of restraint o ensure forced feedinghydation would prove
extemely distessing and potentially damaging. As aresul, Sasha having boon detained

Sought to balance the risks she presented by granting her regular periods of s17 leave italy
toallow her to leave the hospital ward for a fied period of time so that she could buy her own
food and drink, and later to allow er o stay overnight at home in an environment which she
found les cstessing, this being candtonal on her returning tothe ward at agreed times.

(4) On occasions, however, Sasha's behaviour whilst away fom the ward on s.17 leave prompted
her sponsibie cincian to revoke that 17 leave, and require her fo retum tothe ward. In
those evcumslancas, lagal responsibilty for eneuring Sasha's prompt return to the ward la

police to assitin doing this, the police were not legally blged todo so, and often would
Secline such requests

(6) On such occasions, SBP didnot generally arrange for authorised persons to collect Sasha and
reluen her to the ware, but would instead Seek to ely on her mother reluming her and, n order
to secure Sasha's agreement o this course, would agree not lo insist on her immediate return,
‘Somatimes, his would invave allowing Sasha lo go home overnight and be brought ta the
ward the next day.

(©) On occasions duting such “negotiated extension” periods, Sasha would continu to se-harm
(both through cuting and taking overdoses or go missing fom home, and therefore could not
be returned tothe ward as agreed

‘5 CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course ofthe inguest the evidence ravealad matters gving rise to cancam. In my
pinion thre is a isk that future deaths wil eccur unless action is taken. In the cumstances itis
iy statutory duty to report fo you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

(1) Evidence was given during the inquest by SBP staf on the ward concerned, that the
reason SAP staff dd not arrange to collect Sasha and return her to the ward when her s.17
leave had bean revoked, was that they dd not have the resource to alow them fo do tis,
spit it beng thai legal responsibilty soto do.

(2) Sasha's mother gave evidence that SBP's relance on her bringing Sasha back tothe ward
when s.17 leave had been revoked, placed an unfair and intolerable burden on ber, in
Crcumstances when she and the rest ofthe family were struggling to keep Sasha safe
Knowing that SBP would not send someone aut i collect Sasha made her foal that sho
had no choice but to agree to thei request

should be revoked wae on th aftemoon of her death on 31.317. Although formal
evocation of leave was never finalized, Sasha's mother was given to believe tat it would

‘Sasha was able fo run off and tak the substantial Proprandlal overdose which proved To

(On the 5° January 2019, evidence was heard touching the death of Peter George Garvin, Mr Garvin, hac
ntered the Regent's Canal in Westminster on 31 January 2018, wth the intention of taking his own if, He
‘was 88 years ol at the time of his death, The findings of the count were 2 folows:

Medical Cause of Death

1 @) Drowning

How, when and where the deceased came by her death:

""Mr Garvin was sufering wth a second episode of treatment resistant depression, He had previously
attempted to take his own ie In Oclober 2017, Ator around 10:35 on 31 January 2018 he entered the

i's Canal in Westminster with te Intention of taking hi own fe. There was no third party involvement
He was recovered and recognised as ife extinct at 12:27.

Conclusion of the Coroner as to the death:

Mr Garvin took his own life whilst suffering with depressive illness.

4 | Circumstances ofthe death.

Ate time of his death Mr Garvin was under the care ofthe Community Mental Heath Team, however his
‘mesdcation was being prescrites by his GP. There were intermittent communiation problems between the
CMT and the GP rehis prescrting,

In October 2017 he had required admission but due the lack of local beds he had been hospitalised in Miton
Keynes.

Mr Garvin's ness placed a lot of strain on his elderly wife, but she was not offered a carer's assessment
prior his deat,

His ness was treatment resistant, and he asked for private psychiatric assessment in @ search ofa cure.
He saw a private psychiatrist on 19th January 2018

When the CMHT became aware that he had sought private treatment he was informed that he would be
dlscharged rom the CMHT. He was informed ofthis by his CPN ata home visit of 29"" January 2018. This
had 2 significant adverse effect on his mood. Just two days later, he took his own ite

Iti the policy of Mr Garvin's consultant to discharge patients from NHS care if they ae taken for private
‘woatment apparently ue to concern over potential communcation dificlies.

The private psychiatrist stated in evidence that she could only have seen Mr Garvin intermittent in out
patients which inher view he was tool for, or admit him to hospital. This would have deprived Mr Garvin of
{he option of beng eared for at home in the community

5 | Concems ofthe Coroner:
‘1. That there should be a system of doctor to doctor communication to fcilitate prescribing, for
‘example through drect email contact.

2. Thal there shouldbe suffcient local beds so that such a vunerable person should not have to be
hospitalised so very far from home,

3. That if patients seck private psychatic care they should not be discharged by the NHS. Instead @
memorandum of understanding should be agreed between the NHS and Private psychiatric

7 | Dane Lee Pearson had a history of mental health problems. He had been
diagnosed with depression with psychotc type symptoms. These were
‘exacerbated by his use of amphetamine. He was under the care of the Early
Intervention team and the Community Mental Health Team. On 27th November

‘guidance had not been followed. No risk assessment had taken place. On 13th
December 2017, Dane Pearson was found suspended from a ligature at his
home address 13 Newton Terrace, Dukinfield. Toxicology showed evidence of
‘excessive use of amphetamine, prior to death. There were no suspicious
circumstances or evidence of third party involvement in his death.

‘5 | CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to
concem. In my opinion, there isa risk that future deaths will occur unless action
is taken. In the circumstances, itis my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows, —
‘The inquest heard that:

1. In this case, the CAWN had been issued on imited evidence particularly
regarding identification. In addition, it had been issued many months
after the allegation and after the authorisation. The inquest was told that
the process had not been foliowed relating to timeliness. There was no.

‘documentation in existence explaining the rationale for the issuing of the
CAWN.

2. In issuing, the CAWN there was no evidence that his known vulnerability
hhad been taken into account. A risk assessment had not been carried
‘out. In this case, officers attended at his home address and served the

| CAWN on him He refused to sign it on the basis; he had no knowledge

i of it or the circumstances behind it. It was left with him with no

clarification about what if any steps he could take in relation to it. The
inquest heard evidence that he was deeply worried about it and the
impact of it on his life.

3. The inquest heard that OPUS the Police system did not appear to have
been correctly updated with markers to flag his vulnerability.

4. The inquest was told that he was placed under investigation for a
‘suspected attempt burglary and possession of an offensive weapon. A,
decision was taken by the OIC and his Sergeant that it should be NFAD.
‘The decision was not communicated to Mr Pearson. The officer had not
followed the process for notfication of decisions to those under
investigation. As a result, at the time of his death he believed he may be
charged with a criminal offence. |

‘1a Hanging

Conclusion
‘Suicide. Heather Carey took her own ife when she had been inthe care of NHS Mental
Health Services for 6% months; she had recently been placed on a walling lst of some
24 weeks for Cognive Analytical Therapy. Although Heather Carey was known to be
‘pressed, compounded by the lack of medecaton preserbed to lessen thal depression,
‘and at high risk of suicide from the time she had been discharged from hospital
(Gollowing a serous overdose 6 weeks prior to her death) there was a falure to take
‘adequate and appropriate acion to avert or reduce thal risk an, just 2 days before her
eath, inappropriate steps were taken which may have increased thal isk.

7 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

On 04.07.47 Heather Carey was admitted 28 a voluntary patient to the Mental Health
Unt, Tameside General Hospital, seeking treatment for her enduring mental liness
diagnosed as bi-polar disorder. Heather was detained under section 2 of the Mental
Health Act on 13.07.17. On 24.08.17 Heather Carey was discharged. Her discharge
medicaon was quetapine, intended to lessen the depih of het epressive. mood
Swings. Heather was expecting a referral to have been made that day for a
Psychotherapy assessment.

On ischarge Heather Carey's Out Patient Cline Appointment was to be within 23
‘weeks (14.09.2017) but she was given an appointment on 04.10.17. Following this
appointment Heather was referred for psychotherapy screeningfessessment. Thats the

‘On 02.17.17 Heather was admilied to Tameside General Hospital Raving Taken an)
‘overdose of paracetamol. Queiapine was stopped pending liver and renal function test,
Heather was discharged from Tameside General Hospital on 10.11.17. From discharge
Heather Carey was a Red Zone high proty patient.

Heather atlended for her psychotherapy assessment on 22.11.17. The psychotherapist
was not aware of the recent overdose. Heather was old that she was ready to consider
Cognitive Analytical Therapy but that there was a 24-week walling Ist. The
Psychotherapist sensed a disappointment. The evidence showed that for Heather it
Seemed ike all hope had gone.

‘Thereafter Heather's disengagement from the mental health team worsened.

(On the morning of 20.12.17 Heather Carey hanged herself at her home,

‘The inquest Kentiied a number of issues wich likely contributed to Heathers decision
to end her life. One of those issues related to the long wait folowing discharge belore
psychotherapy would begin.

{At the time of Heathers admission to TGH there was no psychotherapy avalable fo her

‘During the course ofthe inquest, and the investigation leading up ot, the evidence
revealed matters giving ise to concern. n my opinion there isa risk that future deaths
could occur unless action is taken. Inthe circumstances itis my statutory duty to report

toyou.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

(1) Mrs Edwards’ discharge from hospital following overdose on 23"" August to see
‘GP was surprising. It was expected in these circumstances that Mrs Edwards
‘would have been transferred to Landough Hospital for a psychiatric liaison
assessment, Instead, responsibility for any further assessment and treatment
‘of Mrs Edwards was passed entirely to Mrs Edwards and her family.

‘less capable family/indvidual may not have pursued help and fallen through
the cracks. Furthermore, had Mrs Edwards been hospitalised, her treatment
may have been diferent.

{2} The consultation at the UHW on 23 August was poor. The history-taking was
inadequate, as it did not reveal the true extent of Mrs Edwards’ risk in terms of
previous suicide attempts and deep-seated mental health problems.
Furthermore, inaccurate information was communicated to liaison psychiatry:
‘they were told that Mrs Edwards had taken 2 tablets, when she had taken 20.

(2) The GP practice may not have performed sultably frequent medication reviews
with Mes Edwards. Many boxes of dtferent tablets were found atthe family,
home, many on repeat prescription, posing an overdose risk

""ACTION SHOULD BE TAREN

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and | believe you and
Your organisation have the power to take such action. You may wish to consider the
following points:

{a} The identification of patients who require immediate psychiatric
assessment and review by specialist teams;

{b) The care and attention to detail taken by doctors and other healthcare
professionals when noting histories and information from mental health
patients; and

{) The frequency of medication reviews with mental health patients.

2) Mise HUNTER had a ong and sad history which all appeared to stem from the
loss of her 14-month old daughter in 2007 who had died from Septicaemia

itich had rapidly developed from Croup. After her daughter's death, Miss

Hunier developed @ Fisiory of menial heal sues and alcohol relied

‘During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving ise te concern,
In my opinion ther i risk that future deaths will occur uness action is taken. In the
Cércumstances itis my statutory duly to report fo you

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as folows: —

1. Natalia HUNTER's GP, NNN Gave lve evidence about Mise
HUNTER'S 18 previous serous attempts to take her life. During the course of
his evidence he relerred tothe lack of Discharge Summaries from the Isle of
Wight NHS Trust. He said tie not uncommon fora Discharge Summary not to
be sent toa GP's practice by the IOW NHS Trust, rifts sent, for tto be sent
very late after th patient has been discharged from the Trust

2. NM razed concerns about this as the Discharge Summary should contain
etailsof why the pationt was admitted: what care they received during theie
time at the IOW NHS Trust whal medication they wore prescribed, and whether
such medication was inlended tobe continued; and whether there were going
to require ongoing caretreaiment asa result ofthis admission/eatment

3. Ino Discharge Summary is received, it has a big impact onthe care that GPs
ate able to offer to their pationts and the continuity of care which is needed,
particularly in elation to mental heath input

4. On several occasions, MMM had been unaware of the nature of the
‘admissions (which were almost al irked to her serous suicidal attempts) and

‘ignifeanty the ongoing riekof further allempla on Miss HUNTERS We as ha
had either not received a Discharge Summary or had received it to late forit

to have any meaningtul input into Miss HUNTER's care.

5. During the course ofthe ive evidence | heard trom I, Service
Manager for Community Mental Health Services atthe Isle of Wight NHS Trust,
in connection with the lack of sufelent numbers of ou-l-hours mental health
or Crisis staff which are avaliable across the Ile of Wight. His evidence (which
has since been supplemented by up-o-date figures), was thal the team
currently comprises of 11.1 fume equivalent Band 6 mental health stall
‘members, butt really requires 15.74 ful-ime equivalent appropriately qualified
staff members which would necesstate 4.64 fulltime equivalent addtional staff
tobe funded and recruited in order tobe able to oer aul and effective service,

6. The evidence was that there are currently insufficient funds in order for a fll
complement of outo-hours mental healthiCriss elf tobe deployed which is
affecting the way in which the Mental Health service operates and delves care
to those who need i out-of-hours

7. Accordingly, have concems that those who are vulnerable with mental heath
leaves and who need to be seen out-o-hours are currently not in receipt of an
adequately staffed out-of-hours mental health provision,

During the curse ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters ging rset concern. In my opinion
‘there ie ask that future dente wl ocur unless action I taken. In the crcumstances tle my statutory

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are 2 follows. =

1. Theres confusion surrounding the meaning ofthe folowing question Fam NAS Englands

‘the course of considering what the outcome would have been ithe isk assessment had been

Consideration ofnidents where medication hadnot been taken twas the Coroners view that

nd thiscreates ask thatthe score generated may be incorrect and in possession medeation
‘may be authorised where it ought not tobe, putting Ines at sk

2. During the inquest it emerged thatthe mental health nurse who assessed Mr. Delahaye on the
2 January 2018 and the GP whe assessed him fon possession medication on the 2"" January
2018, had not identi rom his notes all relevant past medical conditions. It emerged that
whilst the System One records [case management sytem used across the prison estate) has
‘the feclty to provide a summary of significant past andcurent medical condtion, isnot
relable at HMP Birmingham because condtons are not consistently gventhecorect ead

Tnvestigation and Inquest

‘On 13 May 2016, an investigation was commenced into the death of PATRICIA.
PRISCILLA CHAMBERS, born on 8 February 1965. The investigation concluded at
the end of the inquest heard before a jury between 15 and 23 October 2018.

‘Circumstances of the Death

(On 11 May 2016, Patricia Chambers died by suicide contributed to by neglect. She had
not recently taken her antipsychotic medication risperdione, and had recently used
‘cannabis. She climbed over the balcony of the communal walkway on the ninth floor
of Tom Williams House, where she lived, and jumped to the ground. She sustained
‘multiple injuries which were non-survivable. Intervention by the Metropolitan Police
Service before she jumped could not prevent her death,

‘The West London Mental Health Trust operates and is responsible forthe
Hammersmith and Fulham Mental Health Unit. Patricia Chambers had been an in-
patient in the Unit in March 2016.

‘The jury found thatthe discharge process in March 2016 had been incomplete and
{inadequate in the following respects:

‘A.A final risk assessment was not completed prior to her discharge from the ward.

. The discharge medication summary form was not completed accurately in respect
‘of prescription instructions forthe GP.

‘C. The meeting in respect of the discharge did not follow best practice guidelines and
did not include Community Mental Health Team or family members.

. The “seven-day follow-up” recorded was inadequate and prevented effective
follow-up care.

E. The discharge from the ward was not communicated to the CMHT and this absence
‘of communication led toa lack of access to her prescribed drugs.

F. Consistent continuity of care, both in terms of appropriate contact with CMHT or

GP and subsequent application of prescriptions, was lacking due to Patricia
‘Chambers's discharge having not been communicated appropriately.

I 2 00 202 oeings ie Steet Bash
Metal Centre, wer was Patricia Chambers’ General Practice. The jury found that
the following indirect factors contributed to Patricia Chamberss death

A. Patricia Chambers's GP failed to maint

‘complete and timely records.

B. The GP’s process of document control was non-systematic and unsatisfactory in
this case.

‘Coroner's Concerns: West London Mental Health Trust

‘The evidence during the course ofthe inquest revealed matters of concer, which were
reflected in the jury's conclusions. In my opinion, there isa risk of future deaths which
‘may be prevented if appropriate action is taken. Inthe circumstances, it is my statutory

‘Trust. I address this report directly to her on the basis that she seems to me to be the
person who has both sufficient seniority and sufficient proximity to operational matters
to take action (or supervise the taking of action).

1 acknowledge that the Trust carried out a Serious Incident Review under the
chairmanship of SEMEN which was critical of the Trust in tances
‘of Patricia Chambers’s death. An action plan was then created and|

‘explained in evidence (which | accept) the various effective steps which have now
‘been taken.

Thave since heard, through counsel, thatthe Trust has reflected on the evidence and
the jury's findings, and accepts tha there i still concern in respect of:

+ The Discharge Medication Summary (“the Summary”) and the 7-Day Follow-Up,
‘which need to be redrawn

= Communication ofthe Summary to other parties (in particular the CMHT, the GP
and Pharmacy)

= Consistency of the Summary with C2, the Care Programme Approach Policy (which
policy, I understand, is itself currently under review)

~ Compliance of the CPA with the Code of Practice (in particular paragraph 34.11 of
the Code of Practice)

- The appointment, training and supervision of the role of Primary Nurse on the Ward.

this was a contributory factor to Patricia Chambers's death.

In evidence, IEEE old the court that the Practice has an “admin team”, that

longer by fax.

However, [remain concerned becas AI :slosure of records to the

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(On 22"" June 2017 | commenced an investigation into the death of 48 year old
David Morley Sargeant. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on
18"" October 2018. The conclusion of the Inquest was as follows;

David Morley Sargeant died on 16th June 2017 at The Ford, Mawgan, Helston,
Cornwall, rom the toxic effects of an intentional overdose of prescribed and
controlled drugs.

‘My conclusion as to the death is that it was Suicide.

The medical cause of death was established on the evidence as:
41a) disease or condition directly leading to death - Mixed drug toxicity

10 other significant condition(s) which could have contributed to the death but are
not related to the disease or condition causing it ~ suspension by ligature around
the neck.

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

David Sargeant (known to family and friends as Davy) was found deceased in a car
ina rural location following an intentional overdose. The doors were locked, the
only set of keys were inside the vehicle. Davy had a ligature around his neck
which the pathologist considered as secondary measure taken by Davy as part of,
his intention to kill himself

Davy had a history of drug abuse. Davy had received treatment from the Cornwall
drug addiction treatment service, Addaction. Davy displayed a historical pattern

of chaotic illicit substance misuse. These periods were usualy followed by periods
of treatment and stabilisation, which included substitute prescribing and/ or
rehabilitation. The Addaction report stated that during these more stable periods
Inhis life he appeared to become more vulnerable to his ‘ADHD and mental
health’

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to
concern. In my opinion there isa risk that future deaths will occur unless action i,
taken. In the circumstances its my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

In October 2016 Davy was referred by his GP to the community mental health
team (CMHT), part of Cornwall Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (CPT) for
assessment of possible ‘Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder’ (ADHD) which is a
group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness, hyperactivity and
impulsiveness.

Davy was assessed in December 2016 by CMHT. However, Davy was discharged
from CMHT without further diagnosis and treatment. This was because of the
following reasons;-

1) CPTisnot commissioned to assess, diagnose or treat adult ADHD,

2) Addaction Cornwall does not have access to a specialist psychiatrist with
the skills to diagnose or treat ADHD.

3) Although the GP had the option to refer under Patient Choice for
treatment out of county, the GPs previous experience indicated that this was
Impracticable because it would not be possible to successfully deliver the ongoing
oversight and review of medication

In summary, Davy could not be diagnosed and treated by specialist services either
in Cornwall or out of county.

‘ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and | believe your
‘organisation has the power to take such action

| recommend that NHS Kernow reviews the arrangements for the diagnosis and
treatment of ADHD by specialist services either in Cornwall or out of county, with
consideration being glven to the following concerns |

3) CPT isnot commissioned to assess, diagnose or treat adult ADHD.

2) Addaction Cornwall does not have access to a specialist psychiatrist with
the skills to diagnose or treat ADHD.

3) Although GPs have the option to refer under Patient Choice for treatment
‘ut of county, experience indicates that this impracticable because it would not
bbe possible to successfully deliver the ongoing oversight and review of medication.

| would be pleased to hear from you in relation to these concerns.

(On the 9 June 2017, an investigation was commenced into the death of John
Edward Hill born on the 22% January 1940.

“The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on the 22% June 2018.
‘The Medical Cause of Death was:
1a Head Injury due to skull penetrated by rile bullet

‘The conclusion of the Inquest was Suicide.

4” | CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

(On the 26"" May 2017, the deceased was found in a collapsed and unresponsive
Condition In the living room at his home address with a .22 calibre long barrelled
rifle in his hands and a bullet wound to his forehead.

5 | CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to
concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action
Is taken. In the droumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

11. During the inquest evidence was heard that:

ca

Mr Hill was granted a firearms certificate to acquire a firearm on
the 13"" April 2017 by the Firearms Unit at Dorset Palice folowing
‘an application received from him dated the 4 November 2016.
Following receipt of that certificate Mr Hill acquired a .22 calibre
Jong barrelled rifle which he used to end his life 6 weeks later on
the 26"" May 2017.

Mr Hill's son had no knowledge of the application his father had
made until after it was granted. He and his sister had concems
with their father having access to a firearm, as Mr Hill had told
them that when the time came he would end his life by shooting
himself with a rifle,

‘At the time of Mr Hills application, enquiries were made by Dorset
Police which did not include any’enguiries with the family of Mr
Hil or his wife with whom he was living, although the Firearms
Enquiry Officer did see Mrs Hill when she went to interview Mr
Hill on the 20 March.

‘There is national guidance from the Home Office called “Guide on
Firearms Ucensing Law” which was ised in April 2016. Chapter
12 Is entitled Assessing Sutablity and paragraphs 12.35 to 12.42
eal with applications and background checks to be undertaken.
‘At paragraph 12.35 the Guidance states that ""in circumstances
where there is information indicating domestic volence or abuse
wider interviews or enquiries should be considered with a range
Of family, fiends or associates” prior to the issue of the
certificate. There is no further reference to speaking to family
members friends or associates under any other circumstances.

Evidence was further given that in the Dorset Police policy
entitled ‘Firearms and Explosive Licensing Risk Management
Procedure’ dated the 8 May 2015 there is no reference to such
Contact with family members, friends or associates and that
family members or those living at the same address of the
applicant, will not be contacted as standard practice. They may,
‘a above, be contacted where there Is evidence of domestic
‘abuse.

Evidence was given that it would be beneficial for the Firearms
Unit at Dorset Police to write to those living with the applicant to
invite them to raise any concerns they wish to in relation to the
application. Although this may not be responded to, at last it
dives those close to the applicant an opportunity to raise their
oncems. There may be for example domestic violence ongoing
at the address that has not been brought to the Police Force's
attention due to lack of reporting, This would be key to the
firearm appication.

2._Lhave concems with regard to the following:

|. When the Police consider a firearm application, there may be
valuable information that those close to the applicant may have,
In crcumstances where there is no domestic abuse or violence.
‘Those living with the applicant may have vital information, which
could impact upon the grant of a firearms certificate. This
information may therefore be key to preventing a future death.

|i, In view of this I would request that consideration is given to
reviewing the national and local guidance in relation to the
assessment criteria and enquiries to be considered regarding
applications for firearm certificates, and for consideration to be
given that those enquiries involve the applicant's family
‘members, or the at the very least those living with the applicant.

‘ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I
believe you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action. |

YOUR RESPONSE

You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this,
report, 20"" August 2018. I, the coroner, may extend the period.

Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken,

CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to
concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action
is taken, In the circumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

(1) The Post incident Site Report states:
“Ideally this foot crossing should be closed. It crosses railway line that have
trains regularly passing over it at speeds up to 126 mph

“Biggleswade, like many towns, is growing in size and any future development in
this area will bring housing closer tothe crossing

""Would the crossing be installed today?

“if the crossing is a recognised “foot path’ then an enclosed foot bridge, to
Prevent items being thrown at or dropped on trains, should be installed, together
with suitable fencing on both sides of the line adjacent toi, to prevent simple
‘access tothe tracks.

“Currently there is just “post and wire"" fencing immediately next to the adjacent
railway structure

“If the crossing is to be retained, then “repeater lights"" should be installed on
either side of the crossing, so that users on the crossing can be made aware
that a train is approaching”

“Additionally trespass deterrence “Pyramid matting” that has been approved for
use by Network Rail ... or similar should be installed on either side of the
crossing, to deter simple access to the railway. Additional fencing is also
needed between the existing line side fencing and the trespass deterrence to
Prevent access to the embankment.”

| understand that no decision has been made since this Report was made in
January 2018, yet the risk of a future death remains.

© ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN
lin my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and | believe you

(On 2/8/17 1 opened an inquest into the death of Grahame Searby who, at
the date of his death was aged 59 years. The inquest was resumed and
concluded on 158 May 2018

1 found thatthe cause of death to be:
Ja. Hanging

arrived at the following narrative conclusion:
(On 27 July 2017 Grahame Searby, who suffered from extreme anxiety
and depression, was found hanging from a rope attached to a ceiling joist
at the top of the stairs at his home address. It is found that he intended
hhis death. At the time of his death he was under the supervision of the
‘mental health services in the community, and although there was an
‘opportunity to admit him to hospital, it remains unclear whether it
‘would have made a difference to the outcome.

4 | CIRCUMSTANCES OF DEATH

Mr Seatby had a history of suffering from extreme anxiety and
depression for which he was under the auspices of his GP and MHS.
When he failed to attend his medical review appointment on 27/7/17 as
expected, his community Psychiatric Nurse made several unsuccessful
attempts to contact him by phone before attending at his home address to
find no response. This resulted in the attendance ofthe police in order to
conduct a welfare check, and it was then that Mr Searby was to have died
by hanging,

Atthe: ‘evidence was heard from Mr Searby’s mental health team
including| A Before he died Mr
Searby was admitted to A&E on 20/7/17 and 23/7/17 in a state of extreme
anviety when he asked to be voluntarily admitted for treatment to
hospital. After risk assessment it was thought appropriate that he be
placed under the care of the Home based treatment team.

5 | CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the evidence I oc informed me
that atthe time of Mr Searby’s death, the mental health team did not have
access to the system one database or EMIS for the purposes of referencing
the GP's database. Although I was told that access via the system one
data base is currently in operation, there is still no access to the
appropriate date via EMIS

‘The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows. ~
+ Toreview the existing operational systems and to consider the

appropriateness of facilitating access via EMIS in order to improve

3. | INVESTIGATION and INQUEST
The inquest into the death of Stephen lan William Tidey was opened on
6"" January 2017. It was resumed and concluded on 13"" April 2018,

| found the medical cause of death to be:

1a, External Neck Compression
Ib, Hanging

I determined that Mr Tidey took his own life, in part, because it was not
managed despite the fact that the risk of him doing so was recognised by
the Criminal Justice Liaison and Diversion Service and by Police officers
who completed Adult at Risk referral forms.

4 | CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Stephen Tidey was found hanging deceased from a tree outside a cabin in
which he had been residing at Woodsmoke, Farley Heath, Guildford. He
had self-inflicted wounds to both wrists and a note was found on his
body stating that he intended to end his life to spare his family further
suffering,

5 | CORONER'S CONCERNS

Mr Tidey was arrested on 3% February 2016 and, whilst in police custody,
24/39 Adult at Risk or Multi Agency Safeguarding Hub (""MASH"") form
‘was completed by police officers giving a Red RAG status with high risk
of suicide indicated if his relationship with his partner and specifically
his daughter were to fail, and if he lost his job, which were contingent
events.

He was assessed by a member of the Criminal Liaison and Diversion
Service (CLDS) on the same day and was initially assessed by them as
being at risk of self-harm, The member of the CLDS subsequently
telephoned the Home Treatment Team to discuss referring him to the
service. Mr Tidey was then re-assessed by the same member of the CLDS
who stated he appeared calmer and was no immediate risk to himself. No
notes were recorded on the Police or Mental Health Service computer
system to record how this assessment of reduced risk of self-harm had.
been reached.

During the following months, no contact was made by mental health
services with Mr Tidey, and he did not seek their assistance.

(On 26! October 2016 he attended Guildford Police Station to be charged
with the offences and was assessed by Police and a member of the CLDS.
as being at low risk of harm to self.

(On Friday 16% December 2016, Police were made aware that Mr Tidey
hhad lost his job as a consequence of being charged with the offences and
therefore that one of the contingent events highlighted in the MASH.
referral of 32.2016 as placing Mr Tidey at higher risk of self-harm had
‘materialised. They therefore completed a further MASH referral form.
and this was emailed to the MASH hub at 15.40 and forwarded on to
Waverley CMHRS at 16.41

(On Monday 19% December 2016 at 11.30am, Waverley CMHRS
forwarded the MASH report to Guildford CMHRS, but then emailed
again at 11.36am to state they noted Waverley CMHRS should actually
follow up Mr Tidey. However, for reasons, which cannot be ascertained,
‘no further action was taken, It is not possible to ascertain who the dut

‘worker was who received the referral by email
ER. Con munity Services Manager for South West
‘Community Mental Health Recovery Service, stated in evidence that had
he received Mr Tidey’s MASH referral on 16 December 2016, he would
have taken action the same day, initially via a telephone triage
assessment and then via the options available of HTT referral; EDT
Mental Health Act Assessment, crisis planning with safe havens or
CMHRS non-crisis support, as appropriate.

Evidence was given that there were no safeguards in place to check
referrals were being acted upon, and that this remains the case.

Mr Tidey was found deceased on 22! December 2016, the day before he
‘was due to attend Court for sentencing,

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are:

How MASH reports are proces bythe MASH eam upon
rei

Whether here san effective system in place to ensure that MASH
reports are followed upby the appropriate Community ental
Tah Team (where necessary and

Whether there isan effective sem in lace to del appropriately

Consideration should be given to whether any steps can be taken to
address the above concerns.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

(1) That there is no local in-patient detox facility such as used to exist at Millview
Hospital. It is not acceptable that local people needing in-patient detox have to
travel to Islington away from family and friends. Its also unacceptable that the
‘waiting list isso long especially when often Mental Health wil not be fully
adceossed unl detox has taken place. How many dual agnosis patents are
there in the UK?

(2) A much more collaborative approach to dual diagnosis patient's treatment is
needed.
‘The dual diagnosis is at the heart of this problem. Itis not appropriate to try to
‘Separate each component and only agree to treat/assess one component when
the other is dealt with. The dual diagnosis is the person. When in crisis they
are doubly at risk. ‘That period of risk should be reduced as quickly as possible
‘The delays and refusals serve to exacerbate the patient's distress and increase
their despair

(00 05/06/2017 | commenced an investigation into the death of Crstopher Cyt! Kiernan, 52
‘The investigation concluded al the end of the Inquest on 10 October 2017. The conclusion of he
inquest was Suicide. The cause of death was: 1(a) Suspension by ligature.

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH
‘Me Kiernan, who lved with his wife of 30 years, had a history of mental health issues. He had
suffered from periods of depression. He had a habit of crinking alcohol. He also had some
History of cannabis use. Indeed, metabolites of cannabis wore found in his pre ~ mortem blood
‘sample. Infoxicants tended to have a negative Impact upon his mood. |

Mr Kiernan had had involvement with the local mental health services (RDaSH). He expressed, |
to his family, the view that he felt that no one wats lisening to him. He had expressed suicidal |
‘ation to mental health practitioners but not recently to his family

Mr Kieran’s mood was said to have worsened during the week or so prior to his death. He had
become very withdrawn

‘On the evening of Saturday 3 June Me Kiernan made an emergency cal but then aborted the
call without providing any Informatio. In accordance with standard practice, the matter was
{orwarded to an emergency cal handler who, at 22:18, succeeded in contacting and speaking to
Mr Kiernan. ‘The cal handle found it very éiffcut to obtain information from Mr Kieran. He
was uncooperative and appeared to be inoxicated. However, he did make a threat to harm |
himself, The emergency call handler graded the call as ""immediate"" to ansure the prompt |
despatch of resources.

Police officers arrived at Mr Kiernan's home at around 22:30. They found that both Mr and fl
Kiernan were present was unaware that her husband had been in contact withthe
‘emergency services, She arected the Officers to Mr Kieman’s bedroom. The Officers found Mr
Kiernan holding a small hand axe. The offcers instructed Mr Kiernan to pul the axe onthe floor.
‘After several seconds he complied withthe request and apologised saying that he did not know
‘who was about to enter his bedroom.

‘Me Kiernan was sluring his words when he spoke tothe officers. He smolied of alcohol and they |
ormed the opinion that he was intoxicated. He told the ofcers that he was fining it hard 1
cope and thal he was not geting any help regarding his issues. After several minutes, Mr

Kiernan’s daughter arived and began to console her father. Mr Kiernan summarised some

Cogs Rn rc BNE IS

‘background family ise that were Causing im dlstress. Inaly he told the Officers that he fe
lke dying. due to these issues, bu, ater he had spoken to them fora while, Mr Kiernan stated
that he needed help and wanted to speak to someone. He refused to attend hospital for
assistance but did agree to speak toa mental health worker over the telephone

‘The Officers spoke to Me Kienan's family members who agreed to look after Mr Kiernan. They
left the property at about 23:00 hrs. They informed their force contol thatthe ambulance that
‘was en route should be cancelled but thal they should arrange forthe mental heath triage"" to
‘speak to Mr Kiernan that night by telephone

‘The emergency call handlers service desk contacted the YAS triage nurse at 23:03. They id
not contact the crisis team.

[At 23:12 the YAS triage nurse telephoned Me Kiernan's number. He /she spoke to Mr Kieman's
‘daughter who informed hinvher that the poice had left appears that Mr Kiernan was too
intoxeated andlor agitated to speak tothe tiage nurse. The tage nurse left, with Mr Kiernan's
‘daughter, the telephone number forthe RDASH crisis team. Helshe didnot speak to Mr Kiernan
‘eect

‘Mr Kiernan’s daughter then left her parents’ home in order to retum to her own home. She lett
‘he ersis team telephone number with her parents

On 5 separate occasions, between 00:14 and 01:39 on the early moming of Sunday 4” June
2017, Mr Kieman, unboknown 10 his wife, caled the emergency services and spoke to
femergency call handles. During the conversations that took place, Mr Kiernan was generally
fbrasive in manner and cffcut fo understand. He indicated, on mare than one occasion that he
‘was awaiting the call from the crisis team. Notwithstanding note that had been logged on their
PROCAD system, the emergency call handlers appear to have assumed thatthe crisis team
were going to coniact Mr Kiernan and they advised him to clear the line so thal he could receive
‘any incoming cal. Throughout this ‘process, however, the cis team had received no
notification a ll regarding Mr Kieran

‘The PROCAD note refered to above read as flows
‘mental heath nurse has made contact and made arrangements for the daughter to

contact appropriate resources at patients request. No futher requirement for AMB,
‘Thanks

{At around 06:45 on Sunday 4 June 2017, a despatcher noted that the incident relating to Mr
Kiernan wae stil open, He contacted one of the officers who had atlended the previous evening
‘That offer telephoned the home and spoke to Mrs Kleman who assured him that her husband
was asleep in bed.

{At about 11:00 that moming Me Kiernan let the family home. Shortly afterwards he was found in
‘an area of nearby woodland hanging from a tree

‘There was no direct contact between the mental health triage nurse and the crisis team at
RDaSH. Accordingly, since the police ofcers and ther force's service desk appear to have
‘assumed that Mr Kieman’s crisis needs were being met, the RDaSH crisis team were not
ontacted by them. The YAS wiiness who gave evidence atthe Inquest accepted that there

‘appeared o be 8 general misunderstanding as tothe role being played by the triage nurse. She |

Slated that, ad the officers being present when th tiage nurse made contact, the tage nurse
‘wouldlshouis have informed the offices that the YAS mental health service is nol a crisis one.
‘The YAS witness also said that, although the crisis team contact number was lft with the
daughter, there was a means by which the YAS Triage nurse couldlshould have contacted the
ROaSH crisis team drect. The YAS witness algo accepted thatthe crcumstances in which the
‘diet communication pathway between the VAS tage nurse and the ROaSH crisis team should
be subject to consideration

CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS

| make this report under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009,
Paragraph 7, Schedule 5, and

‘The Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013,
regulations 28 and 29.

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(On 19 February 2002, one of my assistant coroners, Heather Williams,
commenced an investigation into the death of Fallon Abby, aged 18
years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7 August
2017.

I made a determination of suicide, when Fallon jumped from the balcony
Cf her sixth floor bedroom at around 10.45pm on Saturday, 18 February
2017, while two members of the ambulance service were attempting to
persuade her to go to hospital for treatment

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Fallon had attended the emergency unit at the Royal London Hospital a
week before her death following an intentional overdose, then re-
presented with alcohol toxicity. She was admitted to Roman Ward of
Mile End Hospital because she was thought to be at high risk of suicide.
She was discharged to the care of the home treatment team on
Thursday, 16 February 2017.

CORONER'S CONCERNS.

During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving
rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur
unless action is taken. In the circumstances, itis my statutory duty to
report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.

| heard at inquest that no member of the team on Roman Ward contacted
Fallon's social worker. There was no protocol for this,

It they had sought a collateral history from the social worker, they would
have discovered that Fallon’s mum was not dead as Fallon had told
them, but was alive and living in a hostel. The social worker had been
rung by a nurse at the Royal London Hospital, but she was waiting to be
invited to a ward round at Mile End Hospital and such invitation was
never made.

It seems unlikely that proper discussion with the social worker would
have changed the outcome for Fallon, but it would have meant that
valuable information would have been shared, and it would have meant
that Fallon would have had the benefit of her social worker on hand upon
discharge. This might be very important for another patient.

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and |
believe that you have the power to take such action,

YOUR RESPONSE

You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date
of this report, namely by 9 October 2017. I, the coroner, may extend the

Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be

‘and reguations 28 and 29 ofthe Coroners (Investigations) Reguistions 2013,

|S) INVESTIGATION and INGUEST

(On 6 February 2017 | commenced an investigation ino the death of Kate Dolby, aged
36. The invesigation concluded atthe end ofthe inquest on 28 March 2017. The
‘conclusion of the inquest was suicide. Kate took an overdose of Propranolol after
carrying out research into this

Please note thatthe issuing ofthis report has been deliberately delayed, forthe reasons
‘et out below.

7 | CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

“The family advised us that Ms Dolby prefered to be referred o as Kao, 80 | wil respect
‘that wishin this repo.

Kate was bor on 29 8.60. Her past psychiatric history included an eating disorder when
‘she was @ teenager. She had also been prescribed ant-dopressants when she was @
student. She appears to have suffered an acute psychotic episode in Api 2016,
resusting inher detention (under $2 of the Mental Heath Act) on 10 Apri 2016. She
‘remained an inpatient at Milbrook unl 13 May 2016. During this edmission, on 19.4.6,
{call was made to the Early Intervention in Psychosis (EIP) team, as had been,
decided that Kate shouldbe refered to them,

“There was confusion about his cll. We heard that there are 2 EIP teams —1 for cy
‘and 1 for county. The call was made tothe county team. Kate's GP surgery is based in
the city. The cal it was aso suggested, cid not provide enough information forthe
‘eferal to proceed. Common sense suggests that more information should have been
requested, and the referral passed to the corect team, Instead, ony a week ater, the
referral was simply dosed. Kate was not even on the waiting list between 26 Apr and 3
June 2016. This is clear breakdown in communication which caused delay toa patient
wating treatment

The only post-discharge review that Kate had after leaving Millbrook on 13 May was a
standard 7 day review by the Criss Resoluton Home Treatment (CRHT) team, who felt
ther well enough io be discharged from ther team, to await review by the EIP team, Ths
We know did notin fact happen fra further 4 mente.

Tr was oniy afer Kai's Gischargo from Mllbcook tha she was revefored fo the EP
team, on 3 June. She effectively went othe back ofthe queue again, and we have
‘heard that there was a significant wating list at that time.

‘During this tine, hee Gs wore becoming increasingly concerned for Kae, Alte rom
the GP ther paychiarist dated 14 June (and chasing eter 9 August) was oly repled
10 by MIIMMon 23 August ~ and received by he GP practee on 31 August 2046. In
tert Myon oe worov bala rerbom beet scomel
peychotc elapse, and coped the ltr tothe EP tam, The ElP team say they never
Feceived letters from the GP from I Ths futher, worrying breakdown in
‘communieaton

Kate was clear struggling inthe months before she was sean by the EIP team. Her
GPs were adjusting her medication as best they cou, whist awaiting input rom mental
health services. During this ime, she was prescrbed @ month's worth of 40 mg
Propranolol (8 tablets), fr treatment of ansety symptoms. Kate's family and
housemate became increasingly concerned about her. She attended the Emergency
Department on 27 July saying she fet suicidal

‘She was riaged by an EIP nurse on 13 July - we heard that his was part ofthe process.
‘Started bythe rust to deal with long wating lists. The nurse who saw her stated she
thought Kate was at risk of relapse without further suppor. It was ony after a phone call
from Kate's GP directly tothe EIP team on 19 September 2016 however, a full 2 months.
‘after that, and § months after she was frst referred to this service, that things started to
happen.

Kate met her care coordinator, KIN on 22 September. IE 2skoo I

(consuitart psychiatrist with the EIP team) to see her urgently. She said she
‘was aware how long Kate had been waiting, anc that she wes concerned about her low
ood EIN toc Kate in bafore her usual cline appointments, on 27 September
2016, Athough Kate talked fo both cinicians about thoughts of suicide, she said she
‘had no plans to carry this out. She was seen and contacted regularly by EM after
27 September, and seemed tobe doing wel. Her housemate described seeing some of
the old Kate coming back’ Her father old us that she seemed the happiest hey had
sen hero ong ne, jst couple of days before her death,

‘Sadiy, we know that Kate was found dead at her home address on 9 October 2016. Her
cause of death was Propranolltoxcty. The police winess told the court Kate had
previously carted out research on her phone about how to overdose using Propranolol
‘She had no previous history of acidental mixing up of tablets or dosages.

‘A key question was whethes earier referal tothe EIP team would have made a
‘erence for Kat| ily accopted that t may have done. tis ofcourse
ifcut to know with any degree of certainty | cannot say, othe required standard of
the balance of probabilities, that earlier treatment would have avoided her death.

‘The trust has not sought to deny or dress up the undoubted fangs inthis case, which

| has been helpful to ths investigaton. There was delay and breakdown in communication

| at multiple stage, resutng in ignfiant delay in Kate receiving the help she needed. Kt

| was more than 5 months between the fst refer, which find wes on 19 Apr, and her
{st meeting a care coordinator and subsequently a psychittin this eam. Kale’

| tamay quite righty refer to a deay in suppor for her. Thats the key issue in is case,

| and i have heard evidence from te trust about changes that have been made to reduce

The risk of tis happening again

‘We have heard that, Because of national guidance issued in Apr last year, patents
referred tothe EIP service are now refered to a Single Point of Access, and allocated @
are coordinator within 2 weeks. Early figures suggest the trust is doing very well with
‘achieving this inthe vast majority of cases

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS
During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In
‘my opinion there is a risk tht future deaths wil occur unless acton is taken. Inthe
‘roumstances itis my statuary duty to report to you.

‘The key area of concern Is:

As with so many matters ike this, central Issue is funding. The NHS, and I think Ris
iro say, mental heath services in particular, are having to spread resources ever
more thinly. The trust has previously raised this issue and appointed 3 more nurses to
‘deal with demand. They have approached the organisation that funds them, Notingham
ity CCG, for funcing for 6 more nurses.

At present, is somewhat reassuring that most patients are being reviewed by care
coordinators from an early stage, but i would appear there isan ongoing problem with
having enough doctors o see these patients. The system appears to rely curenty on
‘care coordinators ientfying those in urgent need and trying to arrange appointment for
‘hem, sometimes outside of usual cinical hours. This seems a somewhat precarious
_system, which relies fo some extent on the goodwill ofthe cnicians themeelves, The
‘evidence | heard was that an independently commissioned report conciuded that the
service requires another full-time consultant inthe EIP team. | am aware that recrutment
ln mental healt services is often dificult and time-consuring, and therefore consider
thatthe process for this shoula be considered without delay.

| was tld that the CCG was to make a decsion about a request fr further funding
‘shorty after the conclusion of the inquest. The trust requested funding for 6 more nurses
‘and fltime consultant

‘tis clear that thre is an ongoing need for more staf to deal with patients requiring the
services ofthe EIP team. | asked the trust to advise me on the outcome of thelr funding
request, and was subsequenty advised (by emal from thei legal advisor on 24.417)
that, at presen, funding has been agreed for 3 care-coordinators, an administrator, and
‘04 medic to suppor EP access.

‘On the bass ofthis information, | remain concemed, particularly about funding or
further medics, inthis team, and have elected to formalise these concerns in 2
Regulation 28 Report

‘There were undoubtedly falings ané communication breakdowns contributing to the
Gelay in Kate's case. However | in that the most significant factor in the delay was the
‘workload and waiting list. This was the key cause, certainly from 3 June 2016 onwards,
which is very much the bigger part ofthe delay inthis case. The tust has addressed
most ofthese issues and | therefore see:no benefit in addressing this report to
Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust s well. The key area of oustanding

‘Soncorn relies to funding

THIS REPORT IS BEING SENT TO:

North Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust

CORONER

|1am Alison Hewitt, Senior Coroner for the City of London.

‘CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS

| make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and.
Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners
(lovestigations) Regulations 2013.

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

| commenced an investigation into the death of Charlotte Anne Agnew
which was concluded at the end of the inquest on 31% January 2017.

My conclusion as to the death was
“Suicide.

‘The Deceased's suicide was possibly contributed to by the failure of
North Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust to () provide
any psychiatric treatment and care after 16 Februaty 2016, despite a
recognised urgent need for the same, and (i) put in place any plan for the
‘management of her risk of suicide.”

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

The circumstances of Charlotte Agnew's death can be summarised as
follows

Charlotte Agnew became psychiatrically unwell in late 2015 and her
symptoms worsened over the following weeks. On 9 February 2016 her
General Practitioner referred her to the North Essex Partnership

University NHS Foundation Trust's psychiatric services on the basis that

‘he may be suffering a psychosis. The Trust was also made aware that
the Deceased was experiencing suicidal ideation. On 15 February 2016
she was assessed by the Trust's Early Intervention and Assertive
Psychosis Team who recognised that she was in need of psychiatric
treatment and care but decided that it was not appropriate for her to be
managed by the EIAP team. The Deceased was referred on to other
psychiatric teams within the Trust but no effective transfer of her care was
‘made and her case was closed. No plan was put in place to manage the
Deceased’s risk of suicide. On 15 March 2016 the Deceased's General
Practitioner made a further referral to the Trust's psychiatric services,
seeking an urgent assessment. The Trust's Access and Assessment
Team provided an appointment for 20 April 2016. In the days prior to her
death on 25 March 2016 the Deceased again expressed suicidal ideation
but on the moming of 25 March she did not display to her family signs of
being acutely suicidal. In the afternoon the Deceased travelled to London,
ingested dangerously high levels of alcohol and medication and, at
approximately 4.00pm, jumped in to the path of a London Underground
tube train as it entered Chancery Lane station,

| CORONER'S CONCERNS:

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise
to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur
unless action is taken in respect of the matters which have not yet been
addressed or sufficiently addressed. In the circumstances it is my
statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows

It was apparent from the evidence that there were five principal failures
by the Trust in relation to the treatment and care provided to the
Deceased. These were:

(1) The Deceased was first assessed by the Trust's Early Intervention
and Assertive Psychosis Team who recognised that she was in need of
psychiatric treatment and care by another team but, despite referring her
fon to other psychiatric teams within the Trust, made no effective transfer
of her care before discharging her back to her General Practitioner and
closing her case. A significant number of clinical and managerial staff
were involved in this process and none of them prevented the
Deceased’s premature discharge.

(2) Prior to the Deceased's discharge no sufficient assessment was made
Of her risk of suicide. Despite at least two clinical staff being involved,
there was insufficient evidence gathering, including from the Deceased's
family, and a wholly inadequate assessment was made despite the use of
the Trust's electronic assessment tool (which was not properly
completed). Further. no plan was put in place to manage the Deceased's

recognised risk of suicide.

(3) Prior to the Deceased's discharge no care plan was put in place and
ro single person had responsibilty for ensuring her care was properly
assessed, co-ordinated and delivered prior to discharge.

(4) The Deceased was discharged back to the care of her General
Practitioner with a recommendation for the prescription of psychiatric
‘medication without her having been seen or assessed by the psychiatrist
who made the recommendation and with no means of monitoring its
subsequent effectiveness,

(5) Despite the matters set out in (1) to (4), the General Practitioner's
request, made on 15 March 2016, for an urgent assessment was not
granted and the Trust's Access and Assessment Team provided an
appointment for a date five weeks later on 20 April 2016.

| was told by witnesses from the Trust (and in submissions made on
behalf of the Trust) that the Trust had adequate relevant policies and.
procedures in place at the time and that the failings set out above
‘occurred because all the staff involved failed to follow those policies and
procedures. It was said that there has been no subsequent amendment
of the policies and procedures but, in summary, that staff have been
reminded of them and what ought to happen (by email) and there is now
an increased level of monitoring of compliance.

Whilst the staff directly involved, who gave oral evidence at the inquest,
told me that they now understand that the above failings ought not to
have happened and would not occur now, | remain concerned that one or
‘more of the above failings could recur in the future. Although the Trust
has taken steps to inform current staff of what went wrong in the
Deceased’s case, it has not taken steps to ensure that the above failings
could not occur again (whether by amendment or clatification ofits
policies andlor procedures or sufficient training of staff or otherwise).

Most particularly, the evidence provided to me did not satisfy me that the
Trust's policies and procedures, and the training given upon them, now
ensure that every patient who is referred to the Trust will be assessed
and treated in a timely manner, even if transfer between teams is,
necessary. Nor did it satisfy me that every patient's risk of suicide is now
properly assessed and managed so as to ensure the risk is minimised.

Inall the circumstances | consider that there is an ongoing risk that any
Cone or more of the above failings could recur. If that risk is permitted to
continue, it could have an adverse impact on the assessment, treatment
and care of current and future patients and upon the protection of their
lives.

‘ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths by
addressing the concerns set out above and | believe you have the power
to take such action.

{recorded that the deceased had a complex background. He had been assaulted
in 2011 and also involved in # road traffic collision. These together with other
life events weie felt to have led toa diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder.
‘The medical cause of death was confirmed as 1a) Asphyxiation secondary to
hanging

Conclusion ~ Deceased had taken his own life

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

‘The Inquest into the death of Thomas Green had heard evidence that in August
2011 at the age of 16 he was assaulted. Following this he had difficulties leaving
the house and became more isolated. On the first occasion he ventured out he
was involved in @ road traffic collision whereby as a pedestrian he was hit by a
motor vehicle which didn’t stop, sustaining injures to his head and legs.

‘The Court heard that following this the deceaseds behaviour and personality
totally changed. He was a virtual recluse, over time he became violent towards
family members, he became paranoid and had mood swings. In September
hhe was referred to the Early Intervention Team as he had expressed both suicidal
and homicidal thoughts. Throughout October 2014 his violent behaviour

Gacalated towards family members and on the 13® November 2014 he was
sectioned under Section 2 Mental Health Act. He remained an inpatient under the
care of EIN from the 13.11.14 until the 5.12.14. During his admission he
‘was diagnosed wit Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.

Despite his inpatient stahus he was refered by III on the 208 Novembet
2014 to General Adult Psychiatry due to his “mixed personality disorder with
paranoid and antisocial traits.” I was unclear what happened with this releral
But it was noted, as sited that this referral was made whilst Mr Green sas an
inpatient. | |

Whilst an inpatient Mr Green was also diagnosed as having @ pineal tumour.

‘On his discharge from hospital Mr Green was placed under the Home treatment
team. He remained under the Home Treatment team until 1"" April 2015 at which
stage he was discharged back to his GP.

On his discharge from hospital there was no follow-up by a Consultant
Psychiatrist nor was there any referral for treatment for his diagnosis of Post
traumatic stress disorder.

In July 2015 his GP made a referral to Tameside and Glossop Healthy Minds for
‘one to one CBT. He had his first assessment on the 26"" October 2015 at which
stage he had a PHQ 9 score of 25 and a GAD score of 17. Due to difficulties
attending and sporadic contact Mr Green was discharged from the Service.

‘A funher referral was made by his GP in May 2016 and the deceased was on a
‘waiting lst at the time he died.

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS
‘The concems noted by the Court during the course ofthe Inquest are as follows:

Pennine Care NHS Trust, Churchgate Surgery and Tameside and Glossop CCG

1. It was unclear why a referral was made to Adult General Psychiatry
whilst Mr Green remained an inpatient, there was no evidence that
referral was ever considered or actioned.

2, Hence when Mr Green was discharged from hospital there was no
Psychiatric follow-up and no treatment plan in place to address the
diagnosis of complex PTSD.

3. When a referral was made this was made to Healthy Minds. The Court
heard evidence how this was not a case which was suitable for Healthy

is as it was complex and involved potentially complex PTSD.

4. The Court heard evidence thatthe referral document completed by the GP
‘was not particularly detailed and therefore the complexity of the case was
‘ot apparent and the case was accepted.

5. The Court heard evidence that there is a commissioning gap for the

‘provision of services for Complex PTSD and complex presentations such
as that of Mr Green.

‘ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN
{In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you
hhave the power to take such action.

‘YOUR RESPONSE

2 | CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS

| make tis report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, ofthe Coroners and Justice Act 2008
and regulations 28 and 29 o he Coroners (Investigations) Fegulatons 2013.

| INVESTIGATION and iNGUEST

(On 5 January 2016 | commenced an investigation ino the death of Dean Gary
‘Saunders. The investigation concluded al the end ofthe inquest on 20 January 2017.
‘The conclusion o he inquest was

‘Dean Gary Saunders killed himself whist the balance of his mind was disturbed and the
cause of death was contnbuted fo by neglect. The jury provided in dalion the folowing
Narrative conclusion This has been an extremely challenging case: the jury
would frst like to express its sincere condolences to Dean’s family

We believe that a number of serious failings led to Dean’s death and we set out
these as follows. There is no particular significance to the order in which we
present them

‘The mental health assessment at Basildon police station was not adequate due to
«failure to pass information pertinent to Dean's then mental state and its
‘consequent risks. The delay in carrying out the assessment contributed to this
serious failing.

While we do not believe that the result of the assessment itself was
predetermined, the pathway to prison was.

On the balance of limited evidence and lack of a proper audit trail we are unable
1 conclude whether sufficient enquiries were made into the availability of beds
‘out of area or privately. The only certainty is that a bed at Brockfield House was

‘only available on # Tanaary 2016,

In was clear Dean was in need of a place of safety, as such his route from
Basildon police staion to prison was the only available option,

In our view the ACCT assessment on 21” December 2015 was not adequately
conducted forthe following reasons:

‘+ No medical or mental health professional attended the
assessment;

+ The assessment did not have sufficient mult-diseiplinary
attendance;

+ The head of healthcare had, to a very large extent, predetermined
that the result of the assessment would be the removal of constant
watch;

+ The head of healthcare treated financial considerations as @
significant reason to reduce the level of observations;

+ The attendees at the assessment failed to review sufficient
background information prior to the assessment, including full and
detailed knowledge of key events such as the plastic bag incident,
which had taken place moments before the ACCT review;

+ The assessment was held prior to the completion of the
psychiatrist's assessment.

HMP Chelmsford’s response to the family in general and on 23 December 2015
in particular was inadequate.

‘These include but are not limited to basic administrative errors, such asa failure
to record and pass on telephone numbers, failure to record all information,
{failure to initiate usage of the phone PIN system, and no consideration of family
‘attendance at ACCT assessments which we feel would have been appropriate in
the circumstances:

ALHMP Chelmsford, there were multiple failings in recording and
communicating pertinent information relating to Dean's circumstances. These
included but are not limited to

Discrepancies between various official records;
Failure to provide full explanations in recorded entries;
Failure to record key incidents;

A complacent approach to Dean's state of mind and
circumstances.

‘There was an absence of clinical leadership in the healtheare wing of HMP
Chelmsford. There was confusion regarding the head of healtheare's
qualifications by members of staf

‘The administration and performance of ACCT reviews was wholly inconsistent

‘and record keeping incomplete. Such as confirming a case manager throughout
the ACCT. confirming risk level on 24 December and other information that
‘must be completed in every cae.

Finally here was « total lack of consistency and logie regarding the level of risk
‘ascribed to Dean's situation and consequent levels of observation.

(On #"" January 2016, the performance ofthe observations was perfunctory asthe
member of staf didnot engage with Dean as required inthe PSI and checks
were not carried out on an irepular bas

‘There was a failure to transfer Dean to a medical facility asthe section 48
process in operation at HMP Chelmsford is contrary to industry best practice.

In adition the psychiatric assessment on 21"" December failed to take into
account the fact that Dean's observation level had been reduced a the ACCT
meeting earlier that day.

Jn summary, Dean SAUNDERS and his family were let down by serious filings
{in both mental health care and the prison system.

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

‘Dean Saunders was 25 years ola the time of his death. On 16 December 2015 he
was delained under 8136 Merial Health Act and assessed at Rochford Hosp. He was
‘Secharged to his parents’ home where an inedent took place involving him stabbing two
family members and threatening fo lake his on ie, He was arested and lake to
Bastion Paice Slaton. On 17 December 2016 Mr Saurders was assessed and not
made subject oa section of the Mental Health Act. He was charged with two counts of
ftempted murder and alle an appearance in Basidon Magistrates’ Cour, he was
remanded in custody to HM Prison Chelmsford. An ACCT ~ Assessment, Care in
Custody and Teamwork - document was opened. He was inital placed under constant
Superson but hs was llr rocuced to twice hour observations. Seven ACCT
reviews were held between 18 and 31 December. Al 10.25am on 4 Jaruary 2016 Dean
was found unresponsive Iving on a maltese in his cal. His death was confined andthe
ause of death provi by the pathoogist, MMI was 1a) electrocution

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving ise to concer. In
my option there isa sk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. Inthe
circumstances, itis my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

1. FOR SEPT:- The admitted lacuna in the SEPT admissions protocol
governing the transfer of mentally disordered people from police
Custody. The current admissions protocol does not allow for the
transfer of any individual from police custody, irrespective of the
criminal charges the individual is facing

Cont

2, FOR SEPT AND NHS ENGLAND:- The absence of a written record of
the “best practice” forensic pathway referred to by EM in his
evidence, and consideration of whether the transfer of
individuais such as Dean to prison is indeed “best practice”,
taking into account the consequent delay in transfer and the
suitability of the prison environment for mentally disordered
individuals

3. FOR CARE UK, NOMS, SEPT:- The lack of clarity regarding the
hospital transfer process. The evidence at the inquest
demonstrated that this is currently shrouded in confusion and

the PSI and the NHS England “good practice” is

compared). Given that rationalisation of the process is still a

“work in progress"", the family consider that it should be given
urgent consideration

9 regarding the ACCT process. In previous
prison deaths and in response to previous PPO reports, promises
have been made about training having been provided to staff yet
the same mistakes are being repeated. Meaningful action in
required in this regard,

5, FORNHS ENGLAND:- The resilience of psychiatric cover at
Chelmsford prison, which would need to be raised with NHS
England who commission such services and decide on the budget.

6. FORNOMS:- The meaningful involvement of families in the ACCT
process, including by ensuring the formal recording, and
‘communication of concerns raised by a prisoner's family.

‘ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

ln my opinion action shouldbe taken to prevent ture deaths and I belive you and your
‘exganisaton have the power to take such action.

‘YOUR RESPONSE

You are under a duty to respond to ths repor within 56 days ofthe date of tis report,

(On the 28"" Apri 2016 | commenced gn investigation into the death of Rachel Morgan.
The invesigaion concluded on the 9” February 2017 and the conclusion reached by he
Jury was one of Suicide with an appended Narrative. The medical cause of death was
4a) Severe anon bran injury.

‘iio to the bith of her second baby, Rachel was healthy, dd ot tke taking medication
and had no previous mental health Issues. After the birth she became Increasingly unwell
with Nuctuaing moods and emotions, which led to her seaking redial help. She made wo
‘Sulcie attempts, after which she was admitted to hospital. After each admission she was
‘ischarged under the care of home-based community tears. She was dlagnosed with post-
‘natal depression wth paychoUc symptoms, which gradually worsened, with some
‘Muctuations. Rachel had fears of harm coming to her baby but became Increasingly
<dtached from her, though there was no concer that she was a Uweat to her chilen. The
‘mother and baby unt was discussed on seversl occasions with one referral put on Mold
‘awaling a mult-leciptinry eam mesting. Immediately prior to her admission in Ap, her
‘artner and mother gi not fel they could keep her eat nthe community Rachel
[Standed an outpaiens appolatmant on the 2th Apl to review her medications. During
{his appolntnent, the clinielan’s ongoing concern were haightoned by the knowledge tht
‘she had been ordering drugs on te Intarnel to end he fe. Rachel ed ot want tobe
‘dmited to hospital so went home, whore she was retrained unl professionals arrive.
‘She was taken to hospital under an emergency section 4 ofthe mental health act due tothe
‘unavaleilty ofa second opinion doctor at hat Ue. The approved mental heath
‘rofeasional provided a verbs! handover tothe ward staf highlighting Rachels history
‘End her eurent high rek. There wore contradictory accounts of te content of the
handover and there were possible omissions ln the handover whlch were not fully
‘documented. Rachol was admitted tothe ward by a section 12 doctor, serve by the
‘lerking doctor. A risk assessment was completed by nursing staff who ily put heron
amber isk of sulci, which was updated to red soon thereafter. She was put on level Liew
‘bservatons and allocated a primary nurse who wes on nights. During her Uma onthe
‘Ward, she was assessed to be engaging and taking to staff but had constant thoughts to
‘ond her if. Concerns were rlsed by nursing staff tout her preoccupation with 2
Nicorette Inalator, concerns which ware recorded onthe PARIS system but were not
Included in an updated risk assessment. Tey were not shared with doctors prior tothe
‘ward round. On the 15th Api the family highlighted specie concerns regarding Rachel's
Safety which were dlcussed by nursing staff, updated onthe PARIS records but were not
‘ded tothe rek assasamnt. The levels of observation were not ralsed. Despite Rachel's
tnd her familys repeated requests to review and change her madicaion, tia was
Continually delayed and no imediate action was taken Rachel was ound at
‘Spproximataly 10:20am on 16th Apr 2076 In room 7 of te Medlock ward, Moorside unit

""Four nurses aiempled Yo open the door to Racha room, one of whom entered to find

Rachel slumped behind the door witha igature acound hor neck. A crash tam ane

‘ambulance sta wee called and CPR was commenced. Rachel was transfered to Salford

opt ep a eprom 2am and deem severe none ram ny on 240
2016.

‘The Jury concluded that Rachel dod as a result of suicide ad recorded the following narrative
conclsone

‘Suicide and Narrative: Th level of observations onthe day Rachel was admitted were
Insufctant. The Trust has accepted that on 12h Api the level of ebservations should
nave been considered on admisalon and a decision to place Rachel on hanced,

‘Sbvervatlons would not have been unreasonable, The information relating to Rachel's

‘been handed over tothe clei conducting the ward round on 15th Api tls possible
{hat had this information been avallsba, the clinician may have altered te level of
‘observations. The information fom during her telephone call tothe Medlock
‘Ward onthe evening of 13th Apel shouts have led to a change In Racha’ level of”
‘observations. We consider that level 1 would have been appropriate. Ths falure to put
‘Rachel on lvel {observations probably contrlouted to her death, as It provided her with
{he opportunity to end her Ife. The ust accopts that onthe 15th Apel 2016 staf could
hhave considered level 2 observations as a minimum, flowing Rachel's mother
{elaphoning the ward with her concerms. The Trust also accepts that he rek assessment
{documentation should have been updated to Include the ew information provised by,
Rachel mother; the diecussion which took place with Rachel and the reasons for the staf!
‘ot increasing levels of observations lz more than likly thatthe delay In reviewing
Rachel's medication contibuted to her Increased hopelessness and ak of auld.

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

‘During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matiers giving rse to concer. In
‘my opinion there is a risk that future deaths wil occur unless action is taken Inthe
‘ereumstances it's my statulory duty to repor to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN ar 2s follows. —

(2) 1am concerned that despite the fact that Rach! Morgan and her family made
Iitclear to the staff atthe Mediock Ward from the start of her admission that
‘she wanted her medication tobe reviewed as felt that her anti-depressant
‘medication was not working, no steps were taken to begin the review process |
‘during the 4 days she was an inpatient before her death. 1am concerned that in
‘the knowledge that Rachel was reporting issues with her medication,
‘medication summary could have been undertaken before the fist ward round
took place on the 15"" April, Please consider whether on admission patients
‘should have a medication summary completed as part of the clerking process,
‘which would alow any medication reviews to be conducted by an appropriate
Doctor atthe first available opportunity

Q)

1am concerned that on2 occasions matters came to the attention of the
nursing staff that gave them cause for cancern regarding Rachel's risk of self
harm suicide and that neither ofthese incidents generated 2 ful risk
assessment to be conducted, Those incidents were the Incident with the |
[Nicorette Inhalator on the 14” April 2016 and the phone call from Rachel's
‘mother on the 15"" April 2016.

(3) 1am concerned that on 2 occasions that observations were considered and/or
reviewed were conducted, they were not reviewed by a mult-dsciplinary team
as per Paragraph 54 ofthe GMWMIHT Observation Policy 2012. Those

‘occasions were on the 12° April2016 and 15° April2036 evening). Please
consider further training ofall members of staff in elation to the need to
engage in a specifi risk assessment review process with a mult-discptinary
forum following incidents that raise issues in relation to sueide and self-harm,

(4 tam concerned hat there ia lack of cary around the deen vel of
beerations contalned within the GMWMHT Observation Poly 201. In
partly, row your attention to the conclusions ofthe SR Section?
Paragraph in which the authors tate that “the review team recommend that

| consdraton st be gen by Iterated Governance as fo whether here
needs tobe statement added to the poy to ndate that interment
beervatins can be use fran aeesed i (hat not mien or whether
the ply provides sufclent clay a ths respect.

(5) As the Serious Incident Review highlighted, lam also concerned that staff at
‘the Medlock Ward placed an over-reliance on the fact that Rachel was an
inpatient as being a protective facto. The evidence have heard confirms the
findings of the SIR that during her time on the Medlock Ward Rachel's feelings
‘of hopelessness and constant thoughts of self-harm didnot reduce during her
‘time and although her means for ending her own life were reduced, they were
not entirely removed. There was evidence available to nursing staff that could
indicated that Rachel was stil thinking about ending her life whilst an inpatient
‘and was considering the means that would allow her to do so. The jury have
{ound that this was not adequately addressed by implementing enhanced
‘observations

“ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

‘Power fo take such action.

CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS

| make this report under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009,
paragraph 7, Schedule 8, and

The Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013,
regulations 28 and 29,

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

On 21 January 2016, | commenced an investigation into the death of
Tedros Habtom Kahssay, aged 29 years. The investigation concluded at
the end of the inquest yesterday.

The jury made a narrative determination, which | attach,

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Tedros Kahssay killed himself by hanging in HM Prison Pentonvile,
having been admitted a month earlier on a charge of murdering his
pregnant partner.

CORONER'S CONCERNS.

During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving
rise to concer. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur
unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to
report to you.

I list the MATTERS OF CONCERN below, though | am conscious that
some of these have now been the subject of remedial action.

Person Escort Record

1. The person escort record (PER) and appended report of the forensic
medical examiner (FME) that accompanied Mr Kahssay to HMP
Pentonville did not accompany him to nurse reception screening,

Circumstances of the Index Offence

2. The index offence is recorded on the PER (and inputted onto the
prison computer system NOMIS, though not the healthcare computer
system SystmOne), but not the circumstances. The circumstances —
perhaps from the indictment read out in court ~ may be potentially
helpful to healthcare and possibly also to discipline staff in prison.

This is not clear cut, because the logistics of obtaining the information
and making it available to those who need it are complex;
prosecutions must not be compromised; and there is the potential for
‘making a prisoner's mental state worse by probing the circumstances.

However, it seems that this is an issue that is worthy of consideration,
preferably at a national level

General Practitioner Records

3. The general practitioner records were never obtained (an issue that |
have raised in the past), despite there being a system in place for
Pentonville healthcare administrative staff to do this. Whilst that did
riot impact upon Mr Kahssay's care, it might for another prisoner.

Nurse Reception Screening

4, The first reception screen template contained questions that carried
an inherent ambiguity, in that they related to a change in personal and
family circumstances, which must always be the case when a person
is incarcerated and therefore does not assist in determining which
prisoners are at an increased risk.

(did hear at inquest that any prisoner on a charge of murder will now
be the subject of a psychiatric assessment.)

5. Both nurses conducting reception screening talked offen in evidence
about not being able to do anything other than accept the answers
given by the prisoner. They did not seem to bring any objective
analysis to the screening. The process of nurse screening appeared
at limes to be a tick box exercise.

6. The second reception (well man) screening nurse did not explore the
history of depression recorded, he said because the prison general
practitioner had not prescribed any medication for depression. On
reflection, the nurse thought that he should have asked about it

Resuscitation

7. The resuscitation led by the two nurses occupying the positions of
primary (Hotel 7) and secondary (Hotel 12) leads for emergency
healthcare in the prison that night, was significantly lacking in the
following ways,

‘+ The nurse with primary responsibility for emergency care in the
prison did not have a proper understanding of the nature of a code
red and a code blue prison medical emergency. (I have raised this
issue in the past.)

‘© One minute and twelve seconds elapsed after nurse arrival before
any substantive care was given. The action during that one minute
and twelve seconds did not appear to progress the resuscitation
attempt.

‘+ There seemed no clear demarcation of roles and responsibilities
during the resuscitation. Of course these may change as those
giving resuscitation tire, but the changes seemed haphazard.

+ There was no checking for breath or alway manoeuvre at the
outset or at any time during the resuscitation,

‘+ There was no checking for pulse at the outset, before commencing
chest compressions, or at any time during the resuscitation.

The lead nurse attempted to justify this by saying that she had not
wanted to waste time. This was despite the first action upon
finding the casualty being to apply a blood pressure cuff, on the
basis that this was part of the nurse assessment.

+ When giving evidence, the lead nurse appeared to conflate the
casualty who is in cardiorespiratory arrest with the casually who is
merely unconscious. She repeatedly talked about the need to give
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to an unconscious casualty.
‘She said that, at the time she started chest compressions, she did
not know whether Mr Kahssay was breathing or not breathing

+ When CPR was given, chest compressions were ineffective, being
to0 quick and too shallow.

‘+ There was only one brief attempt to use an ambubag, the majority
of the resuscitation taking place without airway assistance or with
anon rebreathe oxygen mask.

‘+ It appeared that one oxygen cylinder was empty, as it had to be
changed for another.

The nurse leading the resuscitation described it as chaotic. That is
indeed how it appeared to me from her description and from viewing
the bodycam footage.

| was and remain very gravely concerned, not in this respect for Mr
Kahssay who was in fact already dead when resuscitation
commenced, but for anyone else in the prison in need of frst aid.

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and |
believe that you have the power to take such action.

YOUR RESPONSE

You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date
of this report, namely by 6 February 2017. |, the coroner, may extend the
period,

Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be
taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain
why no action is proposed.

1 | CORONER
Richard Travers HM Senior Coroner for the County of Surrey

2 | CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS
I make this report under paragraph 7(1) of Schedule 5 to The Coroners
and Justice Act 2009,

3. | INVESTIGATION and INQUEST
The inquest into the death of Matthew RUSSELL was opened on the 15
April 2015 and was resumed with a jury on the 31* October 2016. The
jury returned their conclusion on the 17 November 2016, having been in
retirement for ten hours and eighteen minutes,

They found the medical cause of death to have been:
la, Hanging.

They concluded with a narrative verdict and a short form conclusion of
suicide.

4 | CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH
At the date of his death on the 6"" April 2015, Mr Russell was a serving,
prisoner, having been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 16 years in
January of that year. He arrived at HMP High Down on the 5® December
2014, following conviction at the Crown Court siting at Croydon and was
immediately placed on an ACCT document and referred to the In-Reach

team for psychiatric assessment. On 10® December 2014 he was assessed
by a GP as suffering from severe depression and was prescribed ant
depressant medication by that same GP. That medication was the subject,
of repeat prescriptions up to the date of his death with no review. The
first ACCT document was closed later in December 2014 and Mr Russell
‘was discharged from the care of In-Reach on the 8"" January 2015. A
further ACCT document was opened on the 17 February 2015 and this
ACCT document remained at the date of his death. Mr Russell had been
diagnosed with ADHD and Dyspraxia at the age of twelve. He had a
history of depression and self-harm and during his time at HMP High
Down he had self-harmed on a number of occasions and had been found,
also on a number of occasions, with a ligature around his neck. Whilst on
the second ACCT document he had been the subject of eight case
reviews, but none of them had been multidisciplinary.

Ator about 19.10 hours on the 5"" April 2015, he was found hanging by a
ligature from the hinge of his cell door. CPR was preformed and he was
transferred to St George's Hospital, Tooting, where he died the following
day.

The jury concluded that there were multiple failures in the management
and application of the ACCT plan procedure which materially
contributed to Mr Russell’s death.

5 | CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise
to concer, Whilst Central and North West London NHS Foundation
Trust were not responsible for the provision of the In-Reach cate at the
time of Mr Russell's death, they took over that responsibility shortly after
his death and, in the absence of the jury, I heard evidence from an
employee of the Trust about the current situation at HMP High Down,

In my opinion, on the basis of all the evidence that I heard in this inguest,
there isa risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the
circumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you,

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are:
Central and North West London Foundation Trust
a. The proper and regular monitoring of all medication that is
prescribed by way of a repeat prescription,
The preparation of structured care plans for each patient.
c. Aneffective procedure for following up patients who fail to attend
pre-booked appointments with clinicians.
d. The effective use of Read Codes on the System One record, to flag
up and highlight significant risk factors in a patient's care.

e. Ensuring that all stalf with responsibility for patients in prison
have received adequate foundation training and on-going training,
in the ACCT procedure.

£ Ensuring that caseworkers are aware of and attend ACCT Case
Reviews for patients under their care.

ig: Ensuring that there is regular effective communication about a
patient's needs with the GPs and the primary healthcare
practitioners at HMP High Down.

HM Prison High Down

‘a. Ensuring that all staff have received adequate foundation and on-
going training in the ACCT procedure, with particular emphasis

+ Requiring ACCT Case Reviews to be multidisciplinary and
thereby ensuring that all relevant medical practitioners are
aware of the date and time of any such review and have
been invited to attend.

+ Risk Assessments in relation to individual prisoners,

b. Ensuring that all Gate House staff understand the proper
procedure to adopt when receiving a call from a prisoner's family
or friends expressing concerns for that prisoner's safety or
wellbeing.

‘ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I
believe that you, the persons listed in paragraph one above, have the
power to take such action.

YOUR RESPONSE
You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of its date;
may extend that period on request.

regular input from the psychiatric services unt the time of his death. Input was provided bythe

patient. A thread running throughout the treatment was a lack of elective communication
between sta members and indeed with the family In terms of progression of Mr Atkinson's
lness which had been diagnosed as depression and anvty with psychotic symptoms
Furthermore, there were key events of significant se harm attempts which were not escalated
by the care co-ordinator fly. Finally when the care co-ordinator let, there were no measure In

which was exacerbated by non-compliance with prescribed medication and

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

‘During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed mattars giving rise to concem. In
‘my opinion there isa rsk thal future deaths wil occur unless action Is taken In the
‘cumstances iis my statutory duty to rept to you

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows, ~

‘Atthe inquest, evidence was glen by the Cornwall Partnership rust and Kernow
Cnical Commissioning Group and the expert Psychiatrist that there was a national
shortage of acute mental health beds nacessitating the use of out of county placements
for patients requting hospaization for ther mental health Wealment_In Cornwall in

2015, the average out of placement was 677 patients par day but on occasions up 1020]
pallets. In the summer of 2016, there were between 30-40 patients pe day placed out
‘6f County (due in pat to renovation works ona local mental heath hospital).

S17 leave is prescribed by the Responsible Medical Officer as part ofthe teatment to
the hospitalised patient inorder facitate them re-ntegrating back ito the community in
2 siructured, safe ané supported way. Typically this would start off wih escorted leave
in the grounds ofthe hospital and hospital local, movin fo unescoried leave and then
to home leave. Latterly the community mental heath services and Home Treatment

Team are involved to ensure a smooth Wansition ofthe patent back to community living,

\When Me Knights mental health deteriorated whilst on leave, there were concerns that a
limited sk assessment was carried out by Cygnet Hospital prior to S17 leave on 21""
‘May 2015 and there was no communication wih the local community mental heath
team and Home Treatment Team in Cornwall noiying them ofthe leave. This meant
that when Mc Krights mental heath deteriorated while on leave, there was no method of
reducing the risk of seltharm or harm to others, as no migation plan had been put in
place in advance of he leave and the Cornwall Community Mental Health Team and the
Home Treatment Team were unaware he was on S17 leave in ther area. The expert
pychiarsts considered that athough misjudgement about leave could occur in any
hospital setting, the fact that Mr Knight was being reated out of County would have
increased the ek of poor communication with the communiy Weatment teams asthe

‘pla wou ot be ama in cal sere and was very ney et ha

—

‘The weatment of mental heath patents generally includes the involvement of significant
family, iends and pels. On Mr Knights previous hospital admissions, his parents and
dog has boon considered a significant protected factersin preventing him sell-harming
‘and also aided in his recovery. Cygnet Hospital was a Shou dive fom Mr Knight and
his parents home. This made it dificult to physically and practically arrange S17 leave
‘and visitng by famiyfriends. There was also the cost of financing the visits. It was not

possible (as on other admissions) due to the distance, for his dog tobe Included inthe
‘eotnen i racers

‘A he inquest the Consultant Psychiatrists (including Expert Psychiatrist) gave evidence
that it was not best practice to reat patients out of county. This was particulary relovant
to patent with chronic mental heath issues (as wih Mr Knigh) where they were well
known tothe local mental heath service and the needs and issue had successhuly
been addressed inthe past “Another issues raised,

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

During Decomiber 2015 Mr. Watkins suflered a deterioration in his mental heath

ated in part fo concerns ha had withthe health of close members of his farsly and
fis own retirement from employment as an accountant. He came under the care of
the mental heath services and was seen by mombers of bath the Primary Care
Liaison Service (PCLS) andthe Intensive Support Team (IST). Me. Watkins had
‘contact both by face-to-face visits at home and ais telephone contact with members
fof those taams on a regular basis. The plan was to try and support Mr. Watkins and
his family at home so a5 to faitate his recovery. However, he developed suicidal
ideation and required two bret hospital admissions one folowing an intontianal
‘overdose of medication,

His famiy became increasingly concerned atthe risk Mr. Watkins posed to himself
fom suilde such that they ramaved all medication from his home, including that of his
wife, and gave him doses of his mediation as required. However. the family were
finding it extremely eiffcut to manage the sivation and keep Mr. Watkins safe. There
was no real improvement in his presentation and there were significant concerns

garding his thoughs of suicide. By March 2016 the family reported they were at
thew wite-ond

‘On 22nd March 2016 Me. Watkins daughtor contacted, via social media, the Associate

{he consultant psychiatrist on the morning of 23rd March 2016 who in turn agreed to
provide a second opinion f appropriate. Mi. Watkin’ daughter was contacted again
{hat morning by tha Associate Practitioner seeking further information. However by
this ime a Monta Health Act (MHA) Assessment had been arranged and this was
planned for that same day.

(On 23rd March 2016 the Associate Practitioner explained the situation tothe Ward
Manager of Aspen Ward who agreed that Me. Watkins could be admited to that ward if
fis admission and detention was required. The Ward Manager contacted tha IST
‘advising that Mr. Walkin could be acmited fo Aspen Ward subject ta bed being
avaliable

‘The MHA assessmont was undertaken as planned by the Approved Mental Health
Professional (AMHP) and two consultant psychialrists and twas determined that he

‘needed to be admitted to hospital under s:2 Mental Health Act 1983. The Section 12
‘approved psychiatrist old the Inquest that Mr Watkins was at high risk of suicide and
al isk of impulsive acs

During the afternoon ofthe 23rd March 2016 the ward was advised thatthe second
tered mental health nurse dua to work the late shift that day was sick and as 8

INQUEST

‘On 22nd July 2015, I commenced an investigation and on 24th July I opened an
inquest into the death of Richard Walsh, who died on 19th July 2015 in HMP
Belmarsh, Western Way, Thamesmead, Londons Case Reft 01936-15 (JB).
Iewas concluded on 27th September 2016. The jury concluded in a narrative
conclusion that he came by his death by suicide. They returned a finding that
omissions in a Mental Health Act Assessment after his arrest and detention in a
police station, before transfer to prison, amounted to Neglect on four counts:
Failure of both psychiatrists and of the Approved Mental Health Act Practitioner
to seek clinical information, Failure to admit to hospital under MHA section, and
Failure to conduct an adequate Mental Health Act Assessment, The jury
concluded that he would not have died when he did if he had been “sectioned”.

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

‘An expert peychiatrist gave evidence, having considered his behaviour of
unprovoked stabbing of 2 boys, his delusions, hiding under a blanket inthe police
station, his obsession with a police woman, his outburst in prison, and study of a
previous admission under mental health care that he suffered from De

(Clerambaule syndrome (erotomania) and was suffering poychoss. After arrest and

‘charged with atempted murder, che deceased had delusions and refused to drink
‘or eat for 48 hours witha stated intention to police officers that he would thus die
‘on the 3rd day. He was remanded to HMP Highdown, where he was segregated
transferred to HMP Belmarsh 3 days later, where he was isolated in a single cell,
for his protection, for 23 % hours a day, where he hung himself after 17 days.

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course ofthe inquest, the evidence revealed a matter giving rise t0
concern that in my opinion means that there is sila risk that future deaths wil
‘occur unless action i taken, In the circumstances itis my statutory duty to report
toyou.

""The MATTERS OF CONCERN ate as follows.

1. The expert psychiatrist gave an opinion that there was a defect in the system of
‘communications between professionals and agencies involved in the eare of Mr
Walsh. There appeared to be not only serious failures of communication, but
failures from inadequate processes of communication between custodial and
health professionals, between police, court, health care and prison services, that
progressively lost crucial information about the risks and needs ofthe deceased as
the passed through different hands. The expert described what staff knew at HMP.
Belmarsh as diluted and grossly distorted. Evidence heard is listed

1) Those conducting the MHA assessment did not discover that, on the very
‘evening of the assessment, the police had been in contact withthe deceased
smother, who had key information about his mental health, nor did examine the
‘custody record or log, nor consult the Detained Persons Medical Forms, which
‘one described as usually containing litte useful information. The Custody
officers and MHA assessors never spoke.

1) The AMHP said that the Mental Health Act (MHA) assessment was put on.
RIO system for Hampshire NHS staff, and could be made available to general
practice or prison healthcare on request, but was not automatically transferred.
‘There was a need for a national process of information sharing.

«) The Custody Advisor informs the court that the national system was that the
Detained Person's Medical Forms (DPMF) were routinely scanned onto the
police RMS system, but the Mental Health Act Assessment isnot. The logic was
‘not apparent, as both would appear to have the same quality of confidence.

«) Medical in confidence information from police stations was sometimes
transmitted in sealed envelopes marked Confidential, traveling with the prisoner,
but the independent psychiatric expert thought that this was the least effective
form of communication and recommended that the assessing team should
‘communicate with the next stage inthe process, such as contacting the catchment
area forensic service by phone out of hours, advising thatthe prisoner is likely to
{30 0 a particular court, and writing a letter with the assessment in office hours,
‘The Police Custody Advisor said that he would not expect the Mental Health Act

‘Assessment report to routinely go tothe court or prisons with the Prisoner Escort
Record (PER), unless the prisoner was sectioned. The logic for this was also not
clear, as the non sectioned patient was more at risk of not having appropriate
mental health care from non communication, than the sectioned one.

©) No report or letter oF appropriate communication about the MHA assessment
‘vas completed in the police station to subsequent health care providers, nor was
there asjstem to require it

‘There was no evidence that the police doctor (FME) and police nurses notes,
called Detained Person's Medieal Forms (DPMFS) were ever seen by anyone with
responsibilty for Mr Walsh in Highdown or Belmarsh prisons, nor evidence of
any established process of transfer ofthe information. Prison staff said that
‘medical in confidence information can be seanned to prison health care, but
there was not an established system of securing medical records from police
stations

{) The Pre Release risk assessment was completed by a custody officer, indicating
that the deceased had no risks. The Custody Advisor indicated that the officer
did not appear to understand the sytem, as this particular questionnaire in the
ceustody record should not have been completed for transfer to court. But it
appeared that its negative entries may have misled others assessing risk at time of
transfer

1) The completion of the PER in the police station did not reflect the contents of
the custody record or custody log, fling to record his attempt to commit suicide
by dehydration, his delusions, his obsession, or that he had been assessed as high
tisk of suicide, The Custody Advisor sai that the system was meant to be that
the PER was signed off by the custody officer, who should have known that the
information was incorrect.

') The police staff completing the PER indicated she routinely did this without
consultation with the custody log or custody record, which was not required,
although the Custody Advisor informed the court that this was not meant to be
the sytem.

{) The care plan atthe police station which was recorded in detail in the custody
record (and is meant to record any rsks and evidence of mental illness) was not
sent onwards with the PER, not was the section on the PER marked Care Plan
completed asthe Custody Advisor informed itshould be. Staff informed the

1a Staff a the fist night centre assessment at HMP Highdown saw the basic
information about his offence andl recent history and the police national
‘computer printout with no markers, although a subsequent one was found with
markers, indicating a previous attempt in custody to hang himself in custody and
a theeat to stab anyone who takes his children. There was no explanation for a
false negative being ent.

Deis not clear ifthe nurse doing the health screen at HMP Highdown was
shown ot looked at the PER from the police tation,

1m) It is not cleat whether the nurse assessing health fitness for segregation in
HMP Highdown by completing a proforma, did consult the System One Medical
Records, but the nurse agreed that he had no information on the prisoner's
‘behaviour and health in the police station, nor over the preceding four weeks,
which he needed, and that he expected the reception nurse to ring information,
+o him and it was not for him to go to Reception to get it.

18) The PER completed at HMP Highdown did not even reflect the limited
information they had received from the police station three days earlier, It
recorded no current health risks although the previous PER from the police
station had indicated ron compliance with MHA assessment and depression,
GP letter received reported a previous overdose in February and the decision had
‘been made in reception that he needed mental health in reach service. The
health care officer just recorded ""fit for transfer""

(0) The prison officer conducting the first night centre assessment in HMP
Belmarsh did not see ot consider the PER from police station to HMP
Highdown, three days previously. He did know he had a serious charge coming
Lup for sentence and had no family support and was going to be isolated for 23 Ye
hours a day in a single cell. He did not know he was depressed and on
antidepressants, and if he had he would have opened an ACTT. Yet this
information was known to health care staff. He reports thatthe nurse told him of
no concerns and he told her of none,

»p) Iewas not apparent chat the first night nurse assessment in HMP Belmatsh
[knew of or included consideration of his status on a “duty care egime”, which
isolated him for is protection from other inmates. The nurse did not feel there
‘was time nor was it his job to review the medical records. He completed his
‘proforma recording what the prisoner replied, even though he had information
that it may be untrue and did not regard it was his job to record or reconcile

differences

4) The reception GP assessment in HMP Belmarsh did not consider his status
isolated on a “duty care regime” although agreed it was risk factor, nor had any
knowledge of hs behaviour inthe police station or see any relevant information
from PNomis or discipline staff

1) The GP doing the GP assessment in HMP Belmarsh informed the court that
‘there was insufficient time in his job to review the inmate medical records. He
agreed thatthe records showed that suicide sx isk factors listed in Early Days in
Custody were present ~ recent change in circumstance, transfer another
establishment, violent offence, history self harm and suicide, potentially category

‘Aand history of mental illness and drug or alcool problems. He had neither
been informed of these factors nor identified them from the records and so
neither opened an ACCT nor referred him to a peychiatrist.

«) He was referred to the MH in-reach team by the nurse. That team reviewed his
‘medical records, showing a history of alcohol abuse and depression on treatment
(hich did noe apparently include any from the police station, which the
peychiatrst said he does not routinely see) and were reassured by his not being
followed up by a psychiatrist in the community after a previous psychiatric
admission, andl by his presentation not raising any concerns for almost all the
doctors anid nurses, who had scen him in prisons. They did not see any PERS,
and was not informed he was being isolated in a “duty of care regime * for 23 %8
hours a day, nor that the victims were children. The decision not to conduct a
psychiatric assessment would have been different if he had seen the PERs or
DPMEFs or MHA assessment, of his in patient psychiatric notes.

1) The indepenclent psychiatrist gave an opinion that the loss of key information
‘was a particular concern as people move in and out of custody so that there was a
potential that information would be lost to the civilian GP.

Whilst some onganizations had taken a number of steps to minimize the risks to
the live of others, particular the development of a national PER, others had only
awoken tothe risks in the closing days ofthe inquest. Virgin Health Care chose
not to attend, Southern Health and Oxleas NHS Trust submitted plans to prevent
fature deaths before the inquest concluded. Hampshire Constabulary reported
changes in traning and staff awareness. Hampshire County Council prepared a
short document of proposed actions, but it was not available as evidence as it was
received by the court after the conclusion of the evidence. The evidence taken as a
whole, sugested that there was a breakdown of communication at every
professional and organisational interface, 18 of which ae illustrated above. There
‘was no agreed system for transfer of health care information from police station.
cout, of from either to prison. There was no functioning and consistent sytem of
‘passing risk information from one detained organization to another. There was
not agreement whether there just was a duty to pass the information or i ft was
‘not in possession, whether there was also one to ask for it and ifso which
individual bore that responsibility. There appeared to be a focus by individuals on.
completing the proforma or questionnaire required by the system, by rote with
either no time to consider the whole person, or no sense tha it was their
esponsibility to consider missing or discordant information orto be proactive in
communicating gaps in knowledge or concerns. From the evidence of a number of,
witnesses, the pattern of communication was not exceptional in this instance but
reflected what usually happened.

2. That the standard of Mental Health Act assessments by these individuals needs
tobe improved, and, given al three were in complete agreement, that also training.
and provision for MHA assessments in police stations more widely may need to be
reviewed.

3. That the inadequacy ofthe nurse assessment of fitness for segregation in HMP

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(On 20 July 2015 | commenced an investigation into the death of Haydn James Burton, 42. The
Investgaton concluded atthe end ofthe inquest on 27 September 2016, The conclusion ofthe
Inquest was that Hayen Burton died as a result of hanging in his prison cel at HMP Winchester.
‘The ur recorded that is mental state at he time was unclear and tat was not possible to.
‘ule out an impulsive act as part of ris personality disorder or as a means to bring altetion to his
perceived plight. This event was exacerbated by an inadequate implementation of ACCT policies
‘and by inficent communication betwoon the various eloments ofthe prison sytem.

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH
Haydn Burton was detained in HMP Winchester as a convicted prsoner and had been made
subject fo an ACCT order at 09.30 on 14 July 2015. He was found at 10,00 in the morning of 15
‘uly 2015 having suspended himself rom a igature point nhs call (83:30). Prison Officers,
heatncare staf and ambulance staf resusctated Mr Burton and he was transferred to Royal

smpshire County Hospital, Winchester where he died of the delayed effects of hgature
‘suspension on 18 July 2015,

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern In my
‘opinion there is a risk that uture deaths wil occur unless action ' taken. In te crcumstances it
| my statutory duty to reper to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are 2s follows. —

(1) The evidence inthis case indicated that prison staff at Winchester Prison are not
Implementing ACCT plans in accordance wih national policy notuilhsanding the training they
have receved and in particular the observations conductes are inadequate | therefore consider
that the process and future vaining neads to be reviewed

(2) The Prison Listener scheme rules as to prisoner conidentaity appeared to be confusing to
{he listener involved inthis ease. The HMP Winchester Listener Scheme Protocol dated October
2012 makes no reference to situations where an “a sk” prisoner admits io having made active
plans for sucide and threatens to self harm inthe future (as in ths case). consider the protocol
for Listeners should make & another exception to the principle of confiertaty so that they can
‘bass. suc information lo prison staff and that Listeners should bs trained to do so if they have
eason to believe there isan imminent risk of sueide even # the prisoners ready subject to an
ACCT.

Geese? Ot Cais i The Coe Wiha, SOETRUL

(3) The case highlighted the limitations of the NOMIS database in relation to recording details of
Closed ACCT plans meaning thal prison staff are requerity unaware of Important information
‘bout ndviduass gathered previously. The case showed that despite the national poley requiring
Case Notes to be made of all ACCT plans tis does nat haapen forall prisoners so that staff are
ignorant even ofthe fact that there was a previous ACCT in place let alone the reason fort. The
ACCT post-closure process should therefore be reviewed. | consider this s partularly relevant
‘where an ACCT is closed and the prisoner is lator released anc then reimprisoned ors
transfered to a eitferent establishment

[ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN
{In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deat and | beiove you HM Prison
‘Servce and (in relation to (2) ony) The Samartans have the power to take Such action.

{given to formally confirming that all necessary documentation has been
Considered prior to the ACCT review, and to ensure the Offcers and Healthcare
Stat are aware of tha responsiilies

2. This ACCT was only open fora short period. I did not serve Liam's needs
properly and was closea before any view system picked up the nadequacts,

Paranoid schizophrenia: Cinial depression; Ansety Symptoms including
Agoraphobia and panic atacks; Obsessive compulsive disorder, and mood
instabay,

18) On the 20! January 2016 the deceased atlempled sulise by taking an
‘overdose and making a deop incision wih @Kchen krife on her let wrist. The
\wound subsequently required plate surgery, As a result she was detained for
short period under the Mental Health Act

7)_ In February 2015 folowing discharge from hospital after the sulide altemp, she
dented tothe mental heelth team that bulders working at her accommodation
ere ‘a big stressor’.

8) Hor sister KEI described, following the discharge from
hospital the on-going building work onthe roof of the deceased's fat as
extremely noisy and frightening for her. The deceased believed workman were
leaving tools outsce her window on scaffoaing to encourage her to kl hese
‘The deceased had also sald she eared tat the bulders were listening In on
telephone conversations with her sister The buiding work on her fat remained
‘on going and was continuing for several months

9) Inher evidence, which | accepted, RIE said that: -

‘+The deceased was vory distressed bythe building work at her flat and needed
respite from it

‘+ Inthe past the deceased had been abe o resid ata halfway house [Dove
House (women's service) provided by SLAM. This provided respite for
vulnerabie people who were not il enough to be admited fo hospital

‘+ The Dove House facility was no longer availabe in 206,

+ After the deceased was discharged from hospital in February 2016 she took
‘ofuge from her fat atthe heme of her boyfriend's mother which was
‘she did not want as she had dficudes around te Wea the idea of family. This
hhad a damaging effect onthe deceased's mental ealth when she retumed to,
her fat after competion of the bulsng work,

10) EEE expressed the opinion that had the Dove House option been available
uring 2016 her sister would stl be ave today. The opinion was based on the
experience that inthe past the deceased had resided at Dove House for shor
petiods and this hada postive effect on her behaviour. The house was notin a
hospital setting but na residential street. She was not detained there and was,
{tee to leave il sho wished

11) liso heard evidence from IGE on behalf of SLAM who informed me
that Dove House closed down about & years ago (0.2008) and it was not known
wether this was due to funding issues or whether the service was considered
otto be effective,

12) fred me that, n 2015, the boa treatment options were:

+ Treatment whist detained under the Mental Health Act 1983.
+ formal adeission to hospital
‘+ Home Treatment team attending the patient at home.

13) [IEE oiso said that in Apri 2016 during the bulding work the Home
‘Trealment team attended on the deceased at home and helped to reduce the
level of cstress and provided sleeping medication.

14) said that the deceased would not have agreed to informal admission
{to hospital whist the bulding works were on gong and that she dd nt ke the
Home Treatment team attending on her at home. She said there was 2 g9p in
the service by not having temporary non-hosptal accommodation as a treatment

option,
15) ASudden Incident (SUI) report, produced by SLAM, addressed the
‘oncom in the fliowing ters:

“Pationt A's sister. pointed out that there was, inher opinion, alack of avaliable
respite for patient A during the period of her building work. She felt that this was
‘an overwhelming experience for hor sistor which had significantly impacted on
her mental state between April and June 2015 ..n the past Dove House had
provided a crucial source of support for her sister when she was relapsing and
‘might have proven a welcome afernative othe stresses of her home
‘environment. Unfortunately this service is no longer available and there aro
[presonty no other crisis options othr than admissions or home treatment”
(Gage 31 paragraph (8) SUI 29/11/18).

416) The SUI report made the folowing recommendation: -

""We recommend the CAG reviews the local need for respite care for clonts
‘experiencing rises which do not meat the threshold for admission and where
Home Treatment isnot sutabelappropriate”

(Gage 32 SUI 2811/8).

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of he Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In
my opinion there isa risk that futur deaths could oocur uress action is taken. In the
‘eumstances lis my statutory dy to report to you

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN aro as follows,

(1) 11am concerned thatthe options for mental i people in the community needing
respite care through SLAM are imited soll to allondance by the Home
‘Treatment team a6 the aerate to hospital admission. In this paricular case |
ound that the avalabilty of Dove House cd, n the pas, provide respite forthe
deceased. | also find, onthe evidence | hear, thal f this opton had boon
‘avallabie in 2016 the death might have been prevented. Whilst the Home
Treatment team could provide suppert by way of medication and counseling it
‘could not deal wth the source ofthe distress the deceased was suffering from
building work

(2) Given the unpredictability ofthe perceptions of people with mental ness inthe
‘community | aso found that having a further option of respite residence in a nan
hospital satin could prevent future slf-nficted deaths. Examples tha spring
to mind na high density aea ike Lambeth, might be bullying by neighbours or
Sources of excossive noise from neighbouring residences as wel as Building

‘wore

(@) 11am concemed that the Dove House faity was withdravm in about 2008
without any provision being made for alternative respite care when H appeared
to have hada beneficial effector the deceased and, by reasonable inference,
‘ther SLAM patens,

(4) Atthe conclusion ofthe inquest, twas suggested to me bythe solistor for
‘SLAM that | should also make a PED report o Lambeth Socal Services as well
‘a8 SLAM, indicated atthe time that | would consier this opton. Having
Feflected on the matter! have decided not to do ths since | consider that the
‘need for respite care isa cinical ise for SLAM in the frst instance. f SLAM
‘eventually consider that respite care ought tobe avallabe then itis matter for
{he organsation fo decide whether to deliver respite care trough is own
resources or by liaising wih other agencies.

""ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

|n my opinion action shouldbe taken by SLAM to prevent future deaths and | believe
your organisation has the power to take the flowing action:

1. Review the local need for respite care fr cllents experiencing crises which do not
‘meet the threshold for admission to hospital and where Home Treatment is not
sulablelappropiate or adequate.

2 Sines the respite care residence option was provided inthe pas, serious
‘consideration should be ven to reintroducing this resource as a treatmentrehabiltation
option

3. when considering the, respite care residence, option itis decided that SLAM does
‘ot have the nancial resources to provide the facility then in my opinion consideration
‘should be given to liaison with other agencies to ensure provision ofthe facility winen
cinicaly required,

4. When responding to this report clear indication shouldbe given forthe reasons why
the Dove House facity was withdrawn in 2006, and in particular whether tis was for
financial reasons or reasons of clinical effectiveness,

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

‘The seriousness of the deceased's condition was realised whist the daceased was at
HMP Durham although probably italy misdiagnosed, During a hypomanic episode
Which lated a numberof weeks the deveased was fora time etn a urine eoaked cal
kinking and washing rm th cal ot ata time when he needed specialist hospital
treatment. The evidence showed that his liness was no properly addressed. At HMP
Durham a psychiatric referral for the purpose of compiling care plan including a plan
for therapeutte medication was never compited and he was transterred to HMP
Haverigg without any steps being taken to pian healthcare for the future, take action to
avoid a recurrence of his lness 0° identity and deal witha relapse should one occur. At
HMP Haverigg there was inadequate mental heath cover wih a times only ane mental

Tealth nurse and no provision for psychiatric reewal He was transferred to AMP”
Kirkham, A lack of suitable payehiaine care facies al HAP Kirkham (among other
things) led to atanster to HMP Fisley, where due to inadequacies of care planning and
‘communication deficits which had been a feature ofthe deceased care whit in prison,
the fact thatthe deceased was relapsing into depression was not recognised. The jury
Concluded thatthe deceased's death by hanging was parly due to deliciencies in mental
healthcare and tally lo properly observe ACCT procedures.

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and | believe you have the
power to take such acon. Evidence a he inquest emerged thal up fo 80% of prisoners
have some mental heath problom but that mental heath faites in prison were not
adequate sufficiently to address mental ilnsses such asthe deceased sullered. In
particular there was seen fo be inadequate consullant psychiatric suppor, lack at long
teem care planning, lack of continuity of care and lack of hospital facies to deal with
acute psychiatric probloms. Such faites as existed wore seen o be inferior othe care
which @ mental il patient would cecaive inthe community. The problem was seen as
running through the prison service as a whole rather than anisoated problem within one
prison establishment and was seen as lusiyng a fundamental review of mental healt
provision within the prison service

(On the 13% day of October 2015 1 commenced an investigation into the death of
‘Tracey Marie Lynch aged 39 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the
Inquest which was conciuded on the 19° May 2016. The conclusion of the Inquest
_was that Tracey Marie Lynch had committed suicide.

1
4 | CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

‘Tracey Lynch, who was suffering from emotionally unstable personality disorder was
‘admitted onto Stevenson Ward, 2 secure psychiatric unt at The Harbour in
Blackpool on the 17° March 2015 following an assessment and having attempted to
thang herself from a tree. At 2 care programme approach meeting held on the 22""*
June 2015 it was agreed that she should be discharged to a suitable rehabilitation
‘ni. Following various assessments and the obtaining of funding @ place was
‘dented at Oswald House, in Oswaldtwiste. It was agreed that she would be
transferred on the 28 September 2015 and It was recognised that the transition
ould be stressful and would lead to an even higher risk of suicide, That risk was
‘not managed in that no final discharge meeting was held; no femirisation vist
ere arranged for Miss Lynch and appropriate escorted transport was not arenged.
En route to Oswald House a major inddent occurred leading to Miss Lynch being
| Sectioned under the Mental Health Act and returned to The Harbour but placed on a
| | ciferent ward and with a diferent responsible diniian. There was a falure by The

Harbour to carry out any assessment as to her then fitness to be discharged and a

fallure by Oswald House to carry out any assessment in relation to her Suitably to

[Be adnitied to Oswald House given the change in her presentation. She was

transferred to Oswald House on the 5® October 2015 and at approximately 3pm on
the 9® October 2015 she hanged herself in the wardrobe of her room at Oswald
House intending thereby to bring about her own demise.

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS {

During the course of the Inquest the evidence revesled matters giving arise to
concern. In my opinion there is 2 risk that further deaths wll occur unless action Is.
taken. In the circumstances It is my duty to report to you the MATTERS OF
‘CONCERN being as follow

1. Despite the fact that there had been a clear change in the presentation of
“Tracey Lynch folowing the CPA Meeting on the 22% June and despite the
fact that arrangements for discharge were not in place unt the 26°
September 2015 no final discharge meeting was held, that is despite the
fact that the responsible clinician the care co-ordinator
| land the deputy manager fom Oswald House KE hoc at

Indicated that they wished for thereto be afral discharge meeting. There
seemed to be no System in pace to ensure that such a meeting would take
place and in order to ensure that appropriate management would take place
(ofthe dscharge toa rehabltation unt

2. The evidence was that femilarsation vis would have been of considerable
assistance to Miss Lynch inthe lead up to her discharge to Osweld House.
Despite that being accepted there appeared to be no system in place to
ensure that such famiiarsation visits woul take place.

3. The evdence wos hat I tne mother of Tracey Lynch, had
alerted the care co-ordinator and the responsible cincan with her concerns
| that her daughter's state of mind was such that unless she was propery
and appropriately escorted in the transport from The Harbour to Oswald |
House that she would attempt to jump from the motor vehide. Those
‘concerns were not addressed such that on the 28° September wien only
‘escorted by the occupational therapist who was driving the vehicle Miss
Lynch was able to grab the stering wheel and cause a serious acident on
the MSS motorway. Despte the fact tat that risk had previously been
identified there was no attempt to seek to manage that nan appropriate
way.

4. Having been detained by the Police and having then been assessed by
Mental Heath Practitioners Tracey Lynch was then detained under Section 3
| ‘of the Mental Heath Act 1963, She was taken from Preston Police Station
to The Harbour at Blackpool. She was placed on a diferent ward and with
2 diferent responsible clinician, | Without carrying out any
form of, hatsoever and with only a cursory glance at previous
records immediately rescinded the Section 3 and without any
consideration ofthe change in circumstance and presentation of Miss Lynch
arranged for her immediate di ‘Oswald House. The evidence was
that the Consutant Psychologi who had been dealing
wth Miss Lynch attempted to contact ut her offer of
assistance was refused. Having been detained for a second time there was
‘| ‘assessment and no care programme approach meeting arranged. That
‘appeared tobe a serous systems failure.

6 —_ ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you
have the power to take such action.

You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days ofthe date of this

my opinion there isa risk that future deaths could ooour uniess action is taken. In the
‘ercumstances its my statutory duty to report to you

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

‘Steven Trudgil had a long and complex mental health history dating back to his
childhood with a range of ciflerent treatments and diferent possible diagnoses,

lt was also clear that he had formed good and meaningful longstanding therapeutic
felatonships with mental health professionals in the recent past and, although he hag
expressed a wish not to go onto the mental health caseload in his new prison during his
short time adjusting and setting in after his transfer to HMP Highpoint, he had been co-
‘operative and compliant with treatment in the past (ler a period of non compliance),
and there was no reason to believe from the detailed picture thatthe evidence gave of
Steven, that this could not be achievable again.

He was clearly a young man with some insight and some complex mental health issues,
‘and the freseting offences and behaviour, longstanding in his case, for which he had
been convicted was a form of behaviour, according to the forensic psychologss' report,
that could, in some cases, have a significant underying psychological component. The
same detailed psychological report also identified five main facore which had been
recognised to underie deliberate fre setting behaviour, and found they could all be

‘elated 1 Siover’s own Tisioy Wt was ako staled that there are current 10
‘standardised treatment programmes for fe setters avalable within HM Prison Service,
anda plot that had been running was no longer accepting referrals,

‘A Therapeutic Community, ater further assessment of Steven's personaly, was a
‘suggested option for Steven's care and treatment But this option, also contained inthe
‘same psychology report prepared for the probation service in advance of any future
parole hearing, was never taken forward as Steven sadly died belore any further parole
hearing took place.

""ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths. it goes without saying
that no eicism is implied or intended of Steven's indeterminate sentence isl, and
there was also evidence of good quality mental health care having been provided to
‘Steven previously while he was in prison. However, was clear from evidence gen that
IPP’s have now been stopped, and it also likely fo be the case that there are other
potentially vulnerable priconere tke Steven who are stil on IPP's within the prison
‘system and at signifcant sk of continuing self harm after serving their tai, fring
‘themselves in a systom where the Parole Board hearings that provide the only possible
‘means by which they could be released are infrequent, only occuring two or three
years. Its also the case that there are complex mental health needs which might
Actually be the reason forthe continuing risk that Keeps then in custody, as with Steven,
Yet the speciic Weatments are not avaiable withn the prison service, notwithstanding
‘900d care undoubtedly provided by good practitioners in eiffeut circumstances.

‘To ty to reduce the risk of future tragedies and fatalities Ike Steven's sad death occuring, |
‘am writing to you as Prisons Minister to respectuly request that consideraton now be
‘vento assessing those prisoners current sil within the prison sence on IP's to see if
‘hey actualy have mental health needs which would be better and more appropriately
‘managed within the mental healt service rather than the prison service, but within an
‘2ppropiaiely secure unt The aim ofthis would be fo ensure that the appropiate level and
form of mental healthcare can be provided fo them In the most sutable envionment in
‘tder fo manage their undetying condition and reduce the risk f suicide, reduce future risk
to the public and give care that might enable them to be more safely released in future,
‘hile sl providing curent public protection by vitue ofthe secuty of the unit.

(1) There is no acute facity in Powys forthe treatment of acutely unwell patients,
which, the evidence showed, often leads to patients being moved the length and
breadth ofthe county to an establishment where a bed can be found. The
‘evidence also showed thatthe local acute unit atthe Redwood Cenize in
‘Shrewsbury had recently experienced asignieant reduction in the number of
‘acute beds available compounding and exacerbating the problem.

(2) Asa consequence of 1 above there i offen a lack of contnuty of treatment
‘which can be to the detriment ofthe patient concemed

(@) The evidence showed that, on balance, itis cel thatthe experience of being
‘sectioned in these crcumsiances had an adverse effect upon Mrs Taylor which
fueled an unwilingness, on her part, to engage with Mental Health
professionals thereby increasing her risk of self harmvsuicide.

How, whan and where and in what circumstances the deceased came by hor
death: :

Jarek was dependent on alcohol. When intoxicated he suffered with suicidal
ideation. On 3/9/2016 he was found hanging in his bedroom deceased. There
‘were no suspicious circumstances. He was heavily intoxicated at the time of his
death,

Conclusion a8 tothe death

""He took his own life whilst intoxicated with alcohol

4 | CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Inthe days leading up to his death he had attended St George's Hospital onthe 30"" and
31"" August consecutively with suicidal Weation in association wth social stress and
‘Alcohol misuse. On each occasion he was seen by Liason Psychiatry and discharged to
{GP folow up. Admission had been requested but he was tol that there was nowre
that he could be atte to. He was not sectonable under to Mental Heath Act. In
‘evidence the court hear tha there sno faclly to admit patients in whom the primary
tlagnosis fs dependence on drugs or alcohol under the psychiatle services in such

On the 9! of January 2014 | commenced an investigation into the death of

Helen England, aged $8. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest
|.on the 7"" March 2016. The conclusion of the inquest was Suicide.

@ | CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH
Helen England has suffered from Bipolar Affective Disorder since 1999 and
between that time and her death she had been detained as an in-patient under
the terms of the Mental Health Act on eleven occasions. On the 15th October
2013 Helen England was discharged from an in-patient compulsory admission to
Leigh Infimary that had been imposed under the terms of the Mental Health Act.
On the same date she was made subject to a Mental Health Act Community
Treatment Order containing certain conditions. Whilst living in the community
subject to the order Holen was subject to socal stresses and her mental health
deteriorated. Her behaviour also gave rise to a concern that she was a risk to
others. On the 18th November 2013 she was re-admitted to Leigh Infirmary
and was subsequently again detained as an in-patient under the terms of the
Mental Health Act. On the 13th December 2013 Helen was again discharged
from hospital and a second Community Treatment Order was imposed. Whilst
in the community Helen again became subject to social and relationship stresses
as had previously happened. On the 22nd December 2013 Helen was admitted
to The Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan, having sel-infoted a superficial
cut to her left wrist and a deop lacertion to her right arm. This was the first
‘occasion in Helen's history upon which she had demonstrably solf-harmed.
During the evening of 2nd December Helen was seen by a Registered Mental
Health Nurse who decided that Helen was not fit for a mental health assessment
at that time, ‘There was a plan for Helen to be seen by her Community Support
Worker the following day, the 23rd December 2013, but this visit was cancelled
by the Community Team due to Helen's hospital admission.

‘On the 2ath December 2073, Helen underwent surgery for the injury to her
Fight arm at The Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan, following which she
was assessed as being medically fit for discharge at about 19.30 hours. At
approximately 20.90 hours Helen was seen on the ward by the same Registered
Mental Health Nurse who had previously seen her on the 22nd December. The
rurse conducted an assessment of Helen's mental health in the course of which
Helen denied that she had intended suicide when she had injured herself, nor
did she admit to having any suicidal ideas at the time of the examination. The
rurse decided that Helen did not meet the criteria for detention under the terms
of the Mental Health Act and it was planned that Helen should be discharged to
reside with her family for the next fow days. The nurse was not required to,
and did nat, seek advice from a doctor when making this decision, despite Helen
boing subject to a Community Treatment Order. The nurse was aware that
Helen was subject to the Order, but was not aware ofits terms since they were
fot included in the records available to the nurse, There was no protocol or
‘quidance in place for the nurse to follow when considering whether or nat to
refer a decision to discharge a patient to a doctor, either when a patient was
subject to a Community Treatment Order or at all. Following Helen's discharge
(on the 24th December 2013, she aid stay with her family until the morning of
the 26th December 2013 when she insisted upon returing to her own home at
5 Sandy Lane Lowton. At or about 10.42 on the 26th December 2013 Helen's
‘mother telephoned Mental Health Services to advise that Helen had returned
home and to express concerns about her safaty. In a second telephone call she
was advised to contact the Police, but she did nat feel able to do this. That call
fended at about 11.12 hours. The Mental Health Nurse tried to contact Helen at
about 11.36 hours and when she could not do so she first. telephoned Helen's
‘mother and then the Police at about 11.44 hours. Te delay of twenty four
minutes between the Nurse speaking to Helen's mother and the Nurse ringing
the Police has not been fully explained. The Police call taker received the call
at 11.51 hours and graded it as requiring an attendance at Holen's address
within one hour, and a Police Officer arrived at Helen's home at 12.11 hours.
The Officer then waited for the attendance of a second Officer before entering
the property, because there was inteligence that one of the occupants of the
property, who was not Helen, had previously injured a Police Officer attending
at the address. A second Police Officer arrived at 12.30 hours and both Officers
entered Helen's home at 12.31, where they found Helen hanging from the
staircase having left notes indicating an intention to end her own life.

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to
concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action
is taken. In the circumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN aro as follows:

(1) There was no protocol nor any guidance in place for Mental Health Nurses at
the 5 Boroughs NHS Partnership Foundation Trust to follow when considering
whether or nat to refer to a Doctor a decision to discharge a patient, following
fn attendance at, or admission to, an acute Hospital consequent upon an
episode of self-harm, particularly when the patiant is subject to a Community
Treatment Order imposed under the terms of the Mental Health Act.

Evidence was given at the Inquest that such guidance will be introduced at the
5 Boroughs Trust and that it would be welcomed in similar Trusts.

| make this report under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009,
paragraph 7, Schedule 8, and

The Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013,
regulations 28 and 29,

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(On 22 July 2015 | commenced an investigation into the death of Brenda
Elizabeth Morris, aged 66 years. The investigation concluded at the end
of the inquest yesterday. | made a determination of suicide, when Ms
Morris drowned herself in the bath at home.

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Approximately three weeks before she died, Ms Morris took an excess of
(Oramorph and was taken to hospital. She then went to see her general
practitioner, who was extremely concerned and arranged for immediate
referral to the mental health services. Ms Morris was admitted to Larch
Lodge, where she was treated as an informal patient. She was given
weekend leave in mid July and again on Sunday, 19 July, the day before
she died.

CORONER'S CONCERNS.

During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving
rise to concer. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur
unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to
report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.

1. Brenda Morris was allowed weekend leave on the basis that her
partner was at home to keep an eye on her, but no member of staff
told him this. This was not a situation where she needed 24 hour
supervision Nevertheless, it would have been helpful for him to
know the basis for the leave, because he would then have
‘modified his own behaviour accordingly

2. The weekend before the weekend of her death, Ms Morris's
partner felt that she had not been well during the weekend leave. |
appreciate that care must be taken not to override a patient's
autonomy, but it might be useful for staff routinely to consider
whether they are able to oblain feedback from family members
after such leave.

8. There appears to be confusion about whether a doctor is needed
to authorise unplanned leave of an informal patient (not relevant in
this case because the leave had already been authorised). Your
serious incident review of this matter indicates that this is
necessary, but | heard evidence that such medical authorisation is
not routinely sought.

4, Substandard documentation in the nursing records had already
been identified before the inquest by your serious incident review.
Without improvement in the records, itis not possible to determine
whether and if so by whom a necessary risk assessment is
undertaken, e.g. immediately before weekend leave is taken.

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and |
believe that you and your organisation have the power to take such
action.

YOUR RESPONSE

You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date
of this report, namely by 16 May 2016. |, the coroner, may extend the
period.

Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be
taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain
why no action is proposed.

| make this report under the Coroners and Justice Act 2009,
paragraph 7, Schedule 8, and

‘The Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013,
regulations 28 and 29,

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

On 31 July 2015 | commenced an investigation into the death of
Chentoori Chanthirakumar, aged 24. The investigation concluded at the
fend of the inquest on 27 January 2016. | made a determination of death
by suicide, when this young woman hanged herself at home on the night
of 29-30 July 2015.

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Ms Chanthirakumar was a fourth year medical student at Barts and the
London who became acutely mentally unwell in the early part 2018. She
was admitted to Mile End Hospital on 16 June 2015 via the emergency
unit, and then spent three weeks in Crisis House before being discharged
with follow up.

Following her attendance at the emergency unit, the medical school also
became involved in supporting her emotionally.

They then sent an email to her on 29 July 2015, informing her that she
would not be able to take her examinations in August 2015, but would be
able to re-take the year.

CORONER'S CONCERNS.

During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving
rise to concer. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur
unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to
report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.

Barts and the London

1. Whilst it was clear to me from the evidence | heard at inquest that
Barts and the London, both in terms of certain individuals within it and
as an organisation, took its pastoral responsibilities very seriously
indeed and made great efforts to support this student, there was one
aspect of their processes that I think would benefit from review.

The decision that Ms Chanthirakumar could re-take the fourth year of
her medical degree was seen by the medical school as a helpful
decision. The re-take was allowed on the basis of her il health and.
was not a criticism of her academic achievement.

That she would not be able to take her fourth year examinations in
‘August 2015 came to be regarded as almost self evident, because
she had not been able to attend the majority of her recent clinical
placement and had been so recently so unwell

However, unbeknown to the university staff, Ms Chanthirakumar
appears to have lacked some insight at this point, and was actually
hoping not to have to re-take the year, but instead to take her fourth
year exams in August 2015,

Given the very particular course of very recent events leading up to
the medical school's decision, | wonder whether a personal meeting
to discuss matters with her could have been arranged, rather than
communicating this by email. A face to face meeting may not
nnecessatily have had any impact on the outcome, but nevertheless |
think would be a helpful consideration for the process in the future.

East London Trust

2. After the medical school was alerted to Ms Chanthirakumar's illness
by two of her friends on 17 June 2015, a senior lecturer working in
student support services (and, as it happens, herself a general
practitioner) rang Globe Ward of Mile End Hospital and spoke to a
treating nurse.

Her intention in making this call was to deliver information, most
specifically to relay concerns that Ms Chanthirakumar was not being
wholly open with staff about the extent of her distress. However, such
was the ward nurse's anxiety not to breach patient confidentiality, the
conversation was not as meaningful or as productive as it might
otherwise have been.

It seems to me that nurses and doctors working in mental health
particularly, would benefit from a reminder of the difference between
absorbing (and, if appropriate, acting upon) concems raised by a
patient's relatives, friends, tutors etc., and divulging a patient's private
details.

In addition, it may well be that a piece of self reflection has already
been undertaken by the mental health team caring for Ms
Chanthirakumar, taking into account the fact that she took her own life
so soon after her discharge from a period of inpatient treatment, and
with her university being unaware of her own expectation that she
would be able to take her exams in August 2015. It seems that such
reflection might usefull inform future practice.

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and |
believe that you and your organisations have the power to take such
action.

YOUR RESPONSE

You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date

3 [INVESTIGATION and INQUEST
(On Tuesday 3 November 2015, I commenced an investigation into the death

‘of Samantha MacDonald, 20 years, born 12” August 1995. The investigation
concluded at the end of the inquest on Monday 25® January, 2016.

‘The conclusion of the inquest was Suicide,

4 | CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

On the 25"" October 2015 Samantha Jane MacDonald jumped from the window
‘of her bedroom on the 14 floor of student accommodation at Eddie Coleman
Court, Safford.

5 | CORONER'S CONCERNS
During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to

concern. In my opinion there is arisk that future deaths will occur unless action
is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

Samantha Macdonald jumped from the window of her bedroom on the 14 floor
of her student accommodation In Salford. The window was not required to be
used as a fire exit because it was too high. The window was fitted with a device
that restricted the distance for which it would open. Evidence was heard that

The device complied withthe relevant Bish Standard and Planning regulations.
IT t had been in good working order it would have prevented the window from
opening sufficiently to allow Samantha's exit. It was, however, broken. Evidence
reveeled thatthe device could be broken bythe application of force without the
use of any tool. It was not possible to discover exactly when the device had
been broken although it had been working during Samantha's tenancy. Simor
devices fitted to other bedrooms in the building had been found to be broken
from time to time. The building is a non-smoking building that is entirely
devoted to student accommodation, and witnesses believed that the devices
had probably been broken so that students smoking in their rooms could avd
detection. Evidence was heard that in accommodation occupied by adults who
might be determined to forcibly defeat window restrictors, for example in a
healthcare setting, risk assessments were recommended to be reviewed and
consideration given to replacing restrctors with more substantial or robust
devices, and for adding a second restrictor to better resist determined efforts to
‘open the window, thus lessening the risk of persons fling either accidentally or
otherwise. Its considered that such assessments would also be appropriate in
student accommodation such as that occupied by Semantha Macdonal

""ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths and 1
believe you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action.

YOUR RESPONSE

You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date ofthis
report, namely by 1* April 2016. I, the coroner, may extend the period.

‘Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken,

{2) The Escort Pokcy does not include information relaing tothe transfer of pationts
Tiom one place to another (in his cave trom an Acute Hospital othe Fermoy Unt) when

2013

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST
On the 3% December 2015 I concluded the Inquest nto the death of Jake

a who died onthe 23.08.2015 at his home
‘Suse OF death was 1a) Hanging 2) Ilicit Drug Use

T recorded thatthe deceased died at his home address. At the time of his death he
‘was using illicit drugs and “legal highs” which were purchased over the internet,
which on balance contributed to his state of mind. I retumed a conchision thet
the deceased had taken his own life.

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

‘The Court heard evidence that Jake was a young man for whom his family had
had no concems until approximately 12 months prio to his death. Following the
death of a family member in 2013 there had been a deterioration in Jake's
‘behaviour and be had also lost alot of weight. In January 2015 Jake was scen by
‘mental health services (RAID) and a referral was made to Phoenix Futures
‘young person drug and alcohol service. He developed a good relationship with
his Substance Misuse worker from this service. It was known that Jake was
buying significant illicit benzodiazepine over the intemet. In 2015 Jake also
presented on three occasions tothe Accident & Emergency Department, three of|
‘these occasions were due to self harm attempts and suicidal thoughts including
‘0n two occasions in April and twice on the 9* and 17° July 2015 when he had
tied a ligature around his neck and taken an overdose,

‘An attendance in March 2015 was due toa seizure.

On each occasion it was felt that his drug use was the primary difculty and he
was referred back tothe substance misuse services,

Although Phoenix Futures were the drug service engaged with Jake they have no
ability to preseribe medication so a referral was made to Trafford AIM a
‘Community Drugs and Aleohol Service.

Due to the seizure in March Jake had required further investigations, this meant
that he was not able to be prescribed Diazepam (which it was recognised he
required in order to be detoxed from his illicit benzodiazepine use). He had.
received a short course from his GP in 20"" march until the 29 April

‘A referal had been made for Jake to be seen by the Community Mental Health
‘Team but the appointment made was at the same time on the 19"" August as he
‘had an appointment with the Trafford Aim Service. Jake was advised to
‘arrange his appointment with the CMHT ~ the Court did not hear any evidence
to explain why the decision was taken to rearange the CMHT appointment as
‘opposed to the appointment with Trafford Aim. The appointment was rearranged.
forthe 28° August, 5 days after Jake died.

‘CORONERS CONCERNS

‘Theconcems noted by the Court during the couse ofthe Inquest areas follows:

1) The Court heard evidence, that his GP had writen to Greater
‘Manchester West on the 23° June 2015 (exactly to whom this leter
‘was addressed is not known as it was not provided in the evidence
from the GP practice) indicating that Jake could be prescribed
‘iazepam following the investigation for his seizure. There was no
indication in the by GM West as to whether this letter had
‘been reotived and if not why not. However neither of the Drug.
Services who were involved with Jake were aware ofthis information
and therefore he was not commenced on any benzodiazepine
eduction. This issue is being brought to the attention of all the
‘recipients ofthis Regulation 28 report including the Medical Director
forthe Greater Manchester NHS Area who will be aware of the same
‘concer raised ina separate recent case.

2) ‘The failure to identify the above issue as part of the review into the
éeath of Jake Robinson is a concem as it highlights « missed
‘opportunity to potentially lean lessons,

3) The fact that Phoenix Futures have no ability to prescribe medication
Ao their services users was a concer. Itmean hat young people with
substance misuse isues have to be refered t Trafford Aim, who are
8 service for people over the age of 26. Jake had a good relationship
with Phoenix Futures but he did siugsle to engage with services

""The fact that be then ad to engage with two services added to what in
the Courts view was a disconnected approach to dealing with Jakes
‘increasing difficulties.

4) There was no explanation in the review as to why the appointment
clash between Trafford Aim and the Community Mental Health Team,
Jed tothe appointment with the CMHT being rearranged. Particularly
as Jake had made two recent serious attempts of self-harm in July
12015 and was at the very least recognised as a high risk of accidental
‘self-harm. Given that Trafford Aim were not prescribing Jake at this
time the Court had some difficulties in understanding what their role
‘was given that he was also under Phoenix Futures for his substance

‘ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you
Ihave the power to take such action. It should be noted that both ofthe medical
practices involved inthis particular case had themselves noted flaws in the
systems and taken steps to address some ofthe issues themselves, however the
findings of the Court highlight an issue which may impact on medi

across Manchester.

‘YOUR RESPONSE
‘You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days ofthe date ofthis
report, namely by 11.02.18 I, he coroner, may extend the period.

12 October 2014, The absence ofan effective translation service to assist with his
limited understanding of English, and a decision made on 7 October 2014 to
reduce the frequency of checks made on his welfare contributed to his decisio
end his life

CORONER'S CONCERNS.

During the course othe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving ise to concer. In
my opinion there isa risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. Inthe
Creumstances iis my statutory duly to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as folows:

4, Piotr Kucharz was a Polish gentleman who commenced living in the United
Kingdom in April 2014. At the time he sought to strangle himself with a cord he
‘was an informal patient at the Conway Ward at Parkwood, a mental health
facility in Blackpool. At his inquest, evidence was heard from a number of
‘members of sta as regards what constitutes an effective observation. He was the
subject of what were described as Safety and Security [SAS] and general
‘observations the completion of which was the responsibility of a number of
‘members of cate salT. The evidence heard from staff raised an area of concern
because that evidence indicated quite clearly that there was a lack of consistency
and clarity as regards what constitutes an effective observation,

‘An independent expert witness indicated ina report that he completed prior to
the inquest that he fet custom and practice was such that some staff were merely
checking on the “whereabouts” ofthe patient

Some staff felt that they were expected to enter the room of the patient and to try
‘ocengage with him and to check the room environment for anything that may
pose arisk to him. Others fel that whether they were expected to actually enter a
patients room to conduct the observation could vary depending on the level of|
risk a particular patient presented, in other words that they felt they had a
clement of discretion as regards whether they entered the room. This evidence
appeared to be in contrast to a Trust policy.

In the case of Piotr Kucharz, as can be seen above he had limited understanding.
of English, and a number of staff gave evidence that he remained in his room
throughout his time on the Conway Ward and did not wish to engage with them,
Nevertheless, the author of the Trust's Sudden Untoward Incident Review
document agreed that there was no such diseretion and that staf ought to enter
the room to complete and effective observation.

At the conclusion to the inquest I expressed the View that I was eoncet
there isa risk of future deaths because staff remain unclear about wh
oan effective observation, and more specifically whether there are
circumstances which may allow them to refrain from verbally engaging with a
patient, or from physically entering a patient’s room to check the environment,
‘and that should that lack of consistency and claity prevail, other patients may be
placed at risk as result of inadequate observations,

For the avoidance of doubi, T confirm that Tam of the opinion that the above
concern remains valid despite the fact that further to Piote Kuchar2's death the
provision of mental health care for patient's such as Piotr has moved from the
Conway Ward at Parkwood to another facility within my jurisdct

‘members of sta who were working atthe time of Piotr’s death cont
employed in a similar capacity.

CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to
concer. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths wil occur unless action is
taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

Alice was known to the Mental Health Services, both as an inpatient and as needing
Care from community services. She was looked after using the Care Programme
Approach,

Three serious falings in her care were identified at her Inquest. It was not possible
to say that they were directy contributory to her death atthe time (ie. on the 20”
January 2015) but, they have raised sufficient concer with me.

(1) When her Care Co-ordinator left the Trust she was not replaced so Alice was,
left without one of the comer stones of the Care Programme Approach.
‘though later a Mutt-Discipinary Team meeting decided she should have a

Heath Visitor wrote of her urgent concerns about Alice in good detailed e-mails
sent to,Alice's GP and to the Community Mental Health Team on the evening of
the 15"" January. Itwas clear that the Mental Health Team should react. Their
response was to phone Alice on the 16” and make an appointment to see her
fon the 28” January.
This “hands off” approach to a known vulnerable patient is unacceptable. The
| Patient should be at the heart of Care Programme Approach care (indeed any
care).

CORONER'S LEGAL POWERS

make this eport under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, ofthe Coroners and Justice Act 2009
and regulations 28 and 29 ofthe Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013.

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(On 25 November 2014 the Senior Coroner commenced an investigation into the death
Cf Mrs Wanda Stachurska ‘The investigation concluded atthe end of the inguest on 20
May 2015. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide, the medical eause of death being
hanging,

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

On 16 November 2014 Mrs Stachurska was brought by ambulance to the Emergency
Department (ED) of East Surrey Hospital (managed by Surrey and Sussex Healtheate
NHS Trust SASH). She had been found hat day by a member of the public having
taken an overdose of 30 sleeping tablets and was atempting to hang herself from a
Didge. She was also hypothermic from immersing herself i the cold water of a brook.
‘She informed the ambulance erew that she had been “eying to commit suicide’

‘Mrs Stachurska stayed overnight in the hospital and the following morning she again
expressed “suicidal intent” to the ED consultant. At around 17.00 hours that afternoon
she was assessed in the ED by mental health nurse from Surrey and Borders Partnership
[NHS Foundation Trust (SABP). That nurse noted Mrs Stachurska now denied suicidal
feelings. She considered that there was a low risk of se harm and hence Mrs Stachurska
was dicharged home at around 19.00 hours, The nurse did not ascettain that Mrs
Stachurska had attempted to selfligature atthe beidge the previous day, although this
information had been handed over orally by the ambulance staff to the ED triage nurse
‘The mental health nurse stated that had she known this information it would have been
relevant to er tsk assessment

Mrs Stachurska was discovered deceased at around 09.00 the following moming, 18
November 2014, having hanged herself from a tree ina park not fat from her home,

Mes Stachurska was Polish and had limited command of English, hence hee assessment

Dy the mental health nurse had to be Tacltated through an interpreter. ‘The nurse
‘considered it was important (0 observe the patient's interaction and non-verbal cues
heough a face-to-face interpreter, ‘The relevant SASH policy was “to only use
interpreters who are bilingually competent, neutral, independent and professionally
trained and qualified” and that “the use of staff is not acceptable unless there are
‘exceptional circumstances” (eg emergency situations). ‘The mental health nurse stated
that this was not an emergency situation. She also stated that she was not awa of the

SH. policy as although she was based at the Fast Surrey Hospital, where she
‘understood SASH policies would apply, she was not equited to be familiar with SASH
policies because she was an employee of SABP.

The interpreter who was then provided to her by SASH was a Polish man who was

employed by a sub-contractor and worked as a security guard atthe hospital. The nurse's

‘experience was thatthe provision of a staff member as a face-to-face interpreter was the
orm rather than an exceptional occurrence.

It appeared from the nurse's account that the provision of the security guard as an
interpreter was sub-optimal in that, although he endeavoured to assist, he did not always
directly translate but rather reported a theme of what was being sid. ""Her view was that
using a professional interpreter may have improved the quality of hee assessment and

lowed her to gain more understanding of the nuances of what the patient was saying.
Adaltionally, she stated that if an interpreter had been provided to her who was at least a
health care professional this would have been better, because that person would have
had more understanding of terms and terminology and the reasons for the assessment.
‘She had in the past completed mental health assessments using members of elnial staff
‘which she had found preferable, Furthermore, it was apparent that the secusity guard
later discussed some information about the paticat with another person. It should be
noted dha although he had been asked by SASH to act asa translator for Polish patients
‘on several other occasions the man had not been given any tnining or guidance by
SASH in respect of how he should carry out this tole and the nurse said that he had not
‘been informed about clinical confidentiality in respect ofthis particular assessment.

[No serious incident report of review of this death has been conducted by either Trust
involved. The mental health nurse had learned of the death from her line manager who
she considered was responsible for reporting the incident and could give no explanation
swhy this ‘grade I” serious incident under the SABP policy had not been the subject of

SABP SI review, ‘The ED consultant was of the opinion that a serious incident eview
was not required under the SASH policy because he believed there had been 0
‘omissions of shortcomings in the clinical care provided by SASH.

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

‘Ducing the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In
my opinion there sa sik that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the
circumstances i is my statutory duty to report to you,

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are s follows. —

(1) That the quality of the mental health risk assessment may be diminished if
(@) Mental health staff are not aware of relevant SASH policies when working at
East Surrey Hospital:

1D thease of unined wa as inert for mental health assesment he

(© staff members who are not heath care professionals are asked interpret dung

(@Staff members who ar asked to interpret during mental heath assessments are
not given any ting or uidance a to ow to cary out this ole

(2) Neither SASH nor SABP had considered that they should underake a serious
incident review into the ease despite the death of a patient only a few houts after
discharge,

(@) An oppomunity to lear lessons from the above events has hence been delayed
and porentially ben lost

() To decline to conduct a serious incident review because of a pre-determined
‘pinion that there had beea not been any omissions or shortcomings by the
organisation might reflect a misunderstanding by SASH of the purpose and value
of such investigations

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

(On 19 November 2014, | commenced an investigation into the death of
Finnulla Catherine Marlin, aged 35 years. The investigation concluded at
the end of the inquest today. I made a narrative determination, which |
attach to ths letter.

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Ms Martin took her own life by jumping from the sith floor balcony of her
home, less than an hour after she had been discharged from the
Whittington Hospital where she had undergone a mental health
assessment.

CORONER'S CONCERNS.

During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving
rise to concer. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur
unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to
report to you.

| am conscious that some matters are already being addressed, but |
think it would nevertheless be helpful to set out my concerns below.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.

Camden and Islington Trust

1. It seemed from the evidence | heard that the Camden and Islington
Trust psychiatry liaison team (doctor and nurse) operating at
Whittington Hospital on the night of 15 November 2015, were not
wholly clear about the protocols for receipt of information from
police officers bringing patients into hospital on a voluntary basis.

2. The team then saw a patient without waiting to obtain the triage
record created by Whitington Hospital Trust staf.

8. The doctor did not ask Ms Martin about thoughts of suicide within
the context of her earlier declaration that she would die that night.

4, He did not ask her about any thoughts of harming another person,
regardless of the fact he was not aware that she had threatened
this.

5. He did not address his mind to what had led up to the police being
called for Ms Martin, nor who had called them.

6. Neither doctor nor nurse obtained a collateral history of events
from a family member before concluding their interview with Ms
Martin,

7. When they obtained this afterwards and then realised that Ms
Martin had left the hospital, they contacted the police but did not
characterise this as an emergency.

8. The crisis team did not pass on information received from Ms
Martin's sister to the psychiatry liaison team with a sufficient
degree of urgency to ensure that this was taken into consideration
before the interview with Ms Martin was concluded,

Whittington Hospital Trust

1. There seemed to be some degree of confusion surrounding the
voluntary attendance of a patient with mental health needs
accompanied by the police, that suggests a multi agency
discussion and agreement would be beneficial

2. I was told at inquest by Camden & Islington that the Whittington
had been unable to locate the Whittington triage record of Ms
Martin’s attendance, and | did not discover any record of the call
made by Ms Martin's sister to the emergency department that
right

Metropolitan Police Service

1. The police call handler who spoke to Ms Martin did not record that
she said: “I need to jump a balcony’. This was important
information.

2. As | have indicated above, the confusion surrounding voluntary
attendance of a patient with mental health needs accompanied by
the police, suggests a multi agency discussion and agreement
would be beneficial

ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and |
believe that you have the power to take such action.

YOUR RESPONSE

You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date
of this report, namely by 26 June 2015. |, the coroner, may extend the
period,

Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be
taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain
why no action is proposed.

‘On the 15th of July 2008 a Care Order relating to Aleysha McLoughlin was made
‘at Manchester County Court upon the application of Bolton Counc

‘Aleysha was then placed with a family member, where she remained settled
‘unt the 9th of September 2012 when she went to stay with her mother and
‘refused to return, On the 8th of October Aleysha left her mother's address and
although there was a short period thereafter when Aleysha retumed to live with
her family member the placement broke down. Accordingly on the 26th of
November 2012 Aleysha was placed with a foster carer where she remained
‘ntl her death in April 2014. As the foster carer lived in a different area Aleyshe
also changed schools, and at first she appeared to make a positive start at her
‘new school. However from in or about March 2013 her schoolwork and
behaviour began to deteriorate.

LUkewise Aleysha appeared to settle well with her foster carer. However on the
13th of March 2013 she left her foster carer’s home and did not return until the
20th of March 2013. When asked where she had been Aleysha said that she hed
been with her mother.

In early June 2013 the head of Aleysha's year at school had a preventative
‘meeting with her and her foster carer to address a perceived deterioration in
‘Aleysha's behaviour. Aleysha did not engage at that meeting, and her behaviour
was perceived to continue to be poor.

(On or about the 8th of June 2013 Aleysha again left her foster carer's home and
did not return until the 20th of June, on this occasion saying that she had been
with her sister.

(On the 25th of June 2013 whist Aleysha's sister was visiting her at her foster
carer's home Aleysha reported to her carer that her sister had taken an
‘overdose. The following evening, the 27th of June, Aleysha herself took an
‘overdose of aspirin and paracetamol. She was taken to the Royal Bolton
Hospital where she initially refused treatment, and even after consenting she
later removed the cannula administering intravenous medication and had to be
persuaded to have it restored. During Aleysha's hospital admission clinicians
from the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) assessed her
‘and a further appointment was made for her to see a CAMHS clinical
psychologist after her discharge from hospital. On the Sth of July 2013 Alysha
attended that appointment with her foster carer. Aleysha did not want any
further involvement with CAMHS and as Aleysha's risk of further self harm was,
for various reasons, believed to be reduced, it was decided that there was no
‘ongoing role for CAMHS at that time, although an offer of re-referral was made
should matters change.

When Aleysha retumed to school after the summer holiday in September 2013,
she was perceived as continuing to be uncooperative and dificult to engage.

On a date between in or about October 2013 and at or about Christmas of 2013
‘one of the Social Workers involved with Aleysha was informed by Aleysha's
foster carer that Aleysha had inflicted some superficial cuts upon herself. The
‘social worker believed that this was a historical event and did not ask Aleysha
about it

(On the 7th of January 2014 Aleysha and her sister both took overdoses of
asprin and they were taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital. Clinicians wanted to
‘admit Aleysha to the hospital for observation because she was believed to have
taken a potentially life threatening overdose, but Aleysha refused to be
admitted. She was seen by a Doctor in the Accident and Emergency Department
Of the Hospital, who decided that she had the capacity to refuse treatment and
‘noted that she was discharged. Aleysha was subsequently seen by a Doctor
specializing in mental health, who had concerns that Aleysha did not, in fact,
have the capacity to refuse treatment. However medical staff would not then
admit Aleysha to the hospital because a medical doctor had discharged her.
‘Whilst discussions about this were continuing Aleysha left the hospital with her
ster, who was also refusing treatment. Aleysha and her sister were retumed to
‘the hospital the following moming, and @ mental health nurse who was a
‘member of the Rapid Assessment Interface Discharge (RAID) team then
‘assessed Aleysha. Aleysha continued to refuse to be admitted to hospital and
‘was then assessed to have the capacity to make that decision. In the course of
the assessment Aleysha told the mental health nurse that she had self- harmed

‘by cutting herself, although she had not done that recently. That information
was not passed to other agencies. Particularly it was not contained in the
information subsequenty passed to CAMHS nor was it vento Social Services
nor Aleysha's School. During the assessment Alysha stated that she dd not
‘then want to end her life but that she had wanted to do so at the time when
she had taken the overdose. tthe conclusion ofthe assessment It was
<etermined that whist Aleysha was not at immediate risk of self harm she was
at ongoing rsk of mpuisve se harm, and arrangements were made for her tO
have an appointment with CAMHS, despite Alysha stating that she would not
attend. Aleysha was also referred to the Safeguarding Children Team at the
Royal Bolton Hosp.

(On the 8th of January 2014 Aleysha was seen by her school nurse, who had
been informed of her hospital attendance by the Safeguarding team. Aleysha
‘dedined further support from the nurse, who did not then contact Aleysha
again,

On the 8th of February 2014 Aleysha and her sister were seen to be on the
‘wrong side of the fencing of a road bridge where they were at risk of jumping
or faling onto the carriageway below. Police Officers attended, and Aleysha
walked off the bridge. She was then detained by the Police under the terms of
the Mental Health Act and taken to the Royal Bolton Hospital, where she was
‘seen by two Doctors specializing in psychiatry and an Approved Mental Health
Professional who was a social worker, for the purpose of a Mental Health Act
assessment. Aleysha did not fully engage during the assessment, and denied
that she had intended to harm herself when she had been on the bridge. The
assessment concluded that Aleysha was not at immediate risk of self-harm, but
that she remained at ongoing risk of impulsive self-harm. Aleysha was then
‘discharged from detention under the Mental Health Act. A further referral was
made to the Safeguarding team and to CAMHS, although Aleysha again said
that she would not attend at CAMHS, stating that she didn't need it. On the 11th
‘of February 2014 a secretary working for the CAMHS team telephoned Aleysha
and offered her an appointment with a mental health practitioner on the 17th of
February, which Aleysha refused. On the 18th of February a social worker
contacted a mental health nurse at CAMHS in order to share information
regarding Aleysha particularly with regard to the events ofthe 8th of February
described above. The ensuing discussion included an acknowledgement of the
risks presented to Aleysha as @ consequence of her impulsive behaviour when
she was with her sister. Aleysha's refusal to engage with CAMHS was also
discussed and the Social Worker planned that Aleysha's foster carer should be
contacted and asked to encourage Aleysha to attend an appointment with
‘CAMHS. On the 25th of February a multi agency meeting was held by social
services to address Aleysha's self harming behaviour and her refusal to engage
with CAMHS. CAMHS were not invited to this, nor to any other meeting. It was
‘agreed that in view of Aleysha's refusal to engage with mental health services
her foster carer should receive some training as to means of promoting
‘Aleysha's engagement with those services This training had not been put into
place by the time of Aleysha's death on the 3rd of April 2014,

(On the 6th of March 2014 Aleysha was excluded from school for five days due
to her bad behaviour. A meeting took place with Aleysha and her foster carer
and an individual programme of lessons was agreed, so as to support Aleysha

‘during the period leading up to her forthcoming public examinations.

(On the 2nd of April 2014 a pupil at Aleysha's schoo! told Aleysha's head of year
that Aleysha had self-harmed by cutting her arms. Aleysha’s socal worker and
her foster carer were informed and when they saw Aleysha an ambulance was
‘summonsed and Aleysha was taken tothe Royal Bolton Hospital with her foster
carer following. When Aleysha was treated she was found to have twenty-nine
recent lacerations on her let arm, together with scaring from older wounds.
Neither Alesha's foster carer nor Social Services had previously been aware
that Aleysha was self-harming to this level. Whilst Aleyshals wound were being
closed the treating nurse asked Aleysha if she wanted to see anyone from the
RAID team, but Aleysha declined. Despite this the nurse contacted the RAID
team and 2 mental health nurse assessed Aleyshe. The assessment concluded
that on this occasion Aleysha's se-harm was not an acute incident of attempted
suicide but that Aleysha remained at ongoing risk of impulsive self-harm, The
‘means of treating thi risk was ongoing psychological therapy such as was
‘offered by CAMHS and the nurse conducting the assessment encouraged Alysha
to attend CAMHS despite her expressed reluctance to do so.

‘At about 3pm on the 3rd of April 2014 Aleysha was found deceased by her
foster carer at thelr home address IIIT She had hanged
herself. Prior to her death she had been researching websites relating to suicide
‘and hanging. She had also taken amphetamine, which could have induced
depression.

‘(CORONER'S CONCERNS:

During the course ofthe inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to
‘concer. In my opinion there isa risk that future deaths will occur unless action
Is taken. In the circumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

Evidence was given at the Inquest that self harm in young people is becoming a
public health crisis. Evidence revealed that 3 out of 10 young people have self
harmed at some time during their lives. Accordingly the matters of concem
revealed were as follows:~

(1) That It should be considered that the system of training for those
working with young people, including teachers, school nurses, foster
‘carers, social workers, mental health workers and medical nurses and
doctors should be reviewed so as to ensure that these professionals
should be alert for signs of seif harm and should take opportunities to
discover themselves so that those harming themselves can be offered
help and support. By way of example evidence was given at the Inquest
‘that the annual health check offered to looked after children did not
include a blood pressure check. If a blood pressure check was included
this would provide an opportunity for signs of self harm to be revealed.

(2) That it should be considered that adaltional_information and
‘encouragement could be offered to young people to inform those able to
help for example teachers, nurses, health professionals etc. when a

""young person becomes aware that another young person is self harming
‘The shocking self harm to which Aleysha Martine Karla McLoughlin had
subjected herself was only revealed when a school friend brought it to
the attention of a teacher. There was no evidence that there was any
system in place to encourage the passing of such information

(3) That it should be considered that systems such as those now being
developed in Bolton should be further developed so as to ensure that
multi agency discussions involving all relevant agencies are held urgently
for those at risk of self harm and particularly for those who do not
‘engage. Evidence was given that meetings concerning Aleysha Martine
Karle McLoughlin did not include the Child and Adolescent Mental Health
Services although evidence was given that their input would have been
valuable.

(4) That it should be considered that a particular pathway of help for young
people who resist engagement should be developed. There was no
evidence that any such formal pathway had been shared at the present
time.

(5) That a review of the capacity of the agencles involved in helping young
people who are self harming to address those matters appropriately
should be considered,

‘ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN

In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I
believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action.

‘YOUR RESPONSE

You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days ofthe date ofthis
report, namely by 3"" June 2015. I, the coroner, may extend the period.

(0n 18/11/2013 | commenced an investigation ino the death of Swart Baumber.
‘The investigation concluded atthe end ofan inquest witha jury on the 3th January 2018.
‘The jury found the medical cause of death was

1a Hanging
‘The determinations and conclusion of the jury was suicide whore they found clear evidence of a
eliverate act by the deceased wih intent to take his Ie By hanging at his cal al HME

2, Alack of understanding of and adequate traning inthe ACCT process, especialy relating to

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

‘The deceased encountered martal problems. On the 200 and 27% October 2013 he was subject

Cn the 28"" October 2013, he poured petrol around his rented property and a fire was started. He

[At approximately 04:10 on the 15"" November 2013, an aticer gained entry to his call and on
‘pening the door the body of deceased fll tothe floor. A laundry bag had been used as a part
ligature and there was also a shoslace igature around his neck.

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my
opinion thee is a risk that future deaths will occur unis action is taken. Inthe cumstances it
Is my statutory duty to report to you.

‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are 2s follows. —

NoMsisoDExo -
ANTLLIGATURE STRIPS ON CELL DOORS

1

‘The deceased was a design engineer and his sketches found after death in his cal
cout diagrammatcaly how he deduced that the gap between the cell door and frame
would allow a ligature to be threaded through and that a wedge could be created with
paper pamphlets fo prevent slippage ofthe ligature.

‘The risk of cell doors being used for ligature points is well known, In HMP Dovegate
alone some years ago, there were 3 suicides cle in time where the upper hinge was
used asa igature point,

However, whilst the current specication for call door design now incorporates. an ant
ligature strip, thre is no cetott programme in operation and thus, there are significant
‘numbers ofcelldoors that do not meet the euent standard

‘The need to eradicate ligature points in cells has been the subject of recommendations in
PPO reports in Norther Ireland (JOHN MARTIN GERARD KENNEWAY published 10.12
2009'""at recommendation 10 ‘and COLIN MARTIN. BELL published 9.1.2009 at
Fecommendaton 9) and many Australian Coronial decisions and observations of
Coroners in England and Wales in the old Rule 43 and the new Regulation 28 reports

Further, this was the subject of detailed commentary in the paper produced by the Jil
Dando institute of Crime Science (University Collage London) where it was recognised as
being of paramount importance thal thera be removal ol az many ligature points as
possible in cals and thal remadial acon would need tobe taken a8 quickly ag possible
Betore a new method spreads within and between establishments

Evidence was given that the cost of @ national retraft programme forall doors being
adapted with an antvigature stip to meet the new dosign would be a significant
proportion ofthe current budget. However, given the particular vulnerabily of prisoners
fn induction and remand wings, a retrofit of those cells doors on such wings not meeting
the requirement would provide some protection and would be a measured response (0
those prisoners who are known tobe at heighlened risk.

NoMs'sODEXo —
‘THE ACCT PROCESS

7

PS16472011 and the Quick Time Learning Bulletin (ssue 12 august 2012) which
Clarifed opening an ACCT was the subject of much scrutiny. There seems to be no
ational pro forma document to guide staff through the process and. document the
decision making. By contrast, the Act 2 Care risk assessment in the Scottish prison
system does provide a structured approach. A pro forma regime would have the

‘advantage of providing an audit Wail and can be reviewed for Waining purposes
Shortcomings emerge.

8. There appears to be on occasions an over reliance on assessment of curent risk
as emphasised in the QTLB of 2012 by considering demeanour and presentation at the
Feception stage. The PPO bulein of March 2015 highights deficiencies in his approach
‘There are known sk factors for suicide and ee-harm and active identfication of relevant
rik factors om documentation and information (e.g. SASH forms and PERS and medical,
records and an FME report) should be fully considered and balanced against apparent
‘mood so that the there is a comprehensive risk assessment. A pro forma document
Could record what factors and documentation have been considered and the reasons for
the decision

8. tis known that a prisoners risk of se-harm andlor suicide may increase in certain
Circumstances. This applied tothe deceased inthis inquest. HMP Gartree have identified
‘measures to ideniy potential riggers and there has been developed a database on
trigger dates but onl for those whe are or have been subject lo an ACCT. This could be
refined to deal with ro assessment of risk for many prisoners if key factors exist. (See
Equaliy and Human Fights Commission pape in 2015 on Preventing Deaths in detention
ff adults with Mental Heath Conditions). Again, the PPO bulletin of March 2015,
highighted ineceased vulnerability where a retraining order was made and this could be
input into a database to prompt a review of risk. The deceased was served with papers
Concerning harassment whist on remand that may have emphasised that his mariage
was over and therefore increased vulnerabilty paricularly when bail was subsequenly
refused and vim impact statements were referred to in cout.

10. The PPO report recommended that an ACCT should be opened whenever a prisoner has
recently sell harmed or expressed suicidal intent

Noms —
HEALTHCARE SCREENING,

11. The healtheare screening which is a question and answer discussion based. on
speciically designed questons is prescriptive. It makes no mention af 5-138 detentions
Which would be a clear indicator of enhanced risk and the deceased had two such
Setentions

‘SODEXO.
ITEMS USED TO FACILITATE SUICIDE

12. Some prisoners at HMP Peterborough aro allowed to carry ther cell door key which is.
placed on shoelaces tied together and placed around the neck of the prisoner which
Clearly creates a sell-made ligature for those who may be a sk

13. In adeltion, the deceased refered to exporimentation by suffocation in his diary by putting

INVESTIGATION and INQUEST

| conducted three inquests into deaths that occurred in Berrywood Hospital and
In two of them the concerns were similar so | have written this report to cover
both deaths.

(On Wednesday 4"" September 2013 | commenced an investigation into the
death of Jane Marie Clark whose date of birth was 20"" July.1989 The
Investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20th January 2015. The
conclusion of the inquest was

The medical cause of death was:

a hanging

The narrative conclusion was:

Jane Marie Clark was an informal patient at Berrywood Hospital Northampton
diagnosed with emotionally unstable personality disorder. On 22""! August 2013,
staff became aware that Jane had been involved in discussions about suicide
With other patients. At 07.00 hours she was found in possession of a ligature.
‘Around 09.30 hours she was granted leave from the ward without an adequate
assessment of the risks, She went to the woods and tied a ligature, intending to
commit suicide. She was found deceased by a passerby at 13.40 hours. Life was
finally pronounced extinct at 14.32 hours.

(On Wednesday 28"" August 2013 | commenced an investigation into the death
of lsobel Griffin whose date of birth was 6"" September 1956. The investigation
concluded on 23rd January 2015. The conclusion of the inquest was:

The medical cause of death

42 hypoxic brain injury

bhanging

2 psychiatric liness

The conclusion was a short form with additional comment as follows
Suicide ~ contributed to by inconsistent community care and difficulties in
treating her mental disorder in the period from 2011 2013, and lack of
adequate risk assessments and a well formulated management plan on the final
admission between 1 and 17 August 2013,

‘CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH

Jane Marie Clark
Jane Clark had a very long standing history of personality disorder and multiple
lengthy inpatient admissions. There were no issues with her care in hospital but
rather that a nurse granted leave without apparently reading the notes which
‘made clear that events in the last 12 hours (including Mrs Griffin's death some
days earlier on the ward, discussions between patients about suicide, to which
discussions Jane was central, attempts by others tote ligatures on the ward in
the early hours of 22nd August, Jane being found in possession of ligature on
the morning of the 22) required afull risk assessment and prompt escalation
to the multi disciplinary team before any decision was made about leave. The
risk assessment documents had further nat been updated. Further, no
boundaries were placed on the leave.

Isobel Griffin
HEB 26 b0en Mes critic’ psychiatrist for many years. When
retired in 2011 Mrs Griffin was seen by numberof eiferent junior doctors in
the community and frequent changes were made to her medication. She had a
numberof admissions tothe Welland Centre and her diagnosis was changed
from recurrent depressive disorder to personality dsorder. On 27 July Ms
Giffin was discharged from the Welland Centre against the wishes of her

family. On 28 July she attempted to take her fe and was readmitted to the
Welland Centre and atthe request of her family transerred to Berywood
Hospital Northampton from 1-17 August 2013. She was commenced on a
medication free tal, She was documented as beng very suicidal in the days
leading to her death and from 7"" August started confiding about attempts to tie
ligatures which was a new development. On 17 August around 8.30 am she
hanged herself from her bedroom door on the ward witha ligature made from
a bathrobe cord anda sweater. Despite efforts to resuscitate her, Mrs Griffin
died on 23 August at Northampton General Hospital

‘CORONER'S CONCERNS

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to
concern. In my opinion there isa risk that future deaths could occur unless

‘action is taken. In the circumstances itis my statutory duty to report to you.
‘The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. —

Re Jane Marie Clark

41. The very challenging events of the previous evening and that morning
ddo not appear to have been handed over and the nurse in charge did not
read the notes before granting leave. Her risk assessment then was ill
Informed. It was not discussed with anyone nor properly documented.

2. She did not place any boundaries on the leave for example providing a
time by which Jane was to return.

3. Risk assessment documentation generally was poor and appeared
perfunctory.

Re Isobel Griffin

1. Mrs Grifin was admitted on 1 August and was not allocated a key
worker until 8"" August. The key worker did not read the notes so was
not aware of the events of the 7”.

2. The risk assessment was not updated with the events ofthe 7"".

3. Mes Griffin's responsible clinician saw her on only one occasion on 14
‘August 2013 at which time he did not read the notes so he was unaware
fof events on the 7°"" when she handed in a belt and scissors and said she
hhad 3-4 times tried to hang herself using a ligature.

4. Aplanned review of medication, diagnosis and treatment never took
place despite a number of references in the notes toit from 6 August
2013. Mrs Griffin had been substantially unmedicated for most of the
admission despite concerns expressed by her family

5. On 11 August Mrs Griffin started to express thoughts to harm others.
These thoughts distressed her. She did not intend to act on them but
they were something new and a measure of her distress. These thoughts
and theie significance were not included in any rsk assessment,

6. Arisk assessment concluded on the 18"", the day ater she had hanged
herself on the ward, purports to be made with her agreement. It was
evidence that risk assessment documentation is cut and pasted rather
than reflecting the true circumstances.

7. The doors do not appear to be ligature proof and litle was made
available by way of evidence as to what measures would now be taken.
to minimise this risk.
